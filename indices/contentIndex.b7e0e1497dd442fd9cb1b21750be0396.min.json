Byzantine and¬†[Muslim alchemists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy_and_chemistry_in_medieval_Islam \"Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam\")¬†were fascinated by the concept of metal transmutation and attempted to carry out the process. The eighth-century¬†[Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim \"Muslim\")¬†alchemist¬†[Jabir ibn Hayyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabir_ibn_Hayyan \"Jabir ibn Hayyan\")¬†([Latinized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin \"Latin\")¬†as¬†_Geber_) analyzed each classical element in terms of the four basic qualities. Fire was both hot and dry, earth cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air hot and moist. He theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them interior and two exterior. From this premise, it was reasoned that the transmutation of one metal into another could be effected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. This change would be mediated by a substance, which came to be called¬†_xerion_¬†in Greek and¬†_al-iksir_¬†in Arabic (from which the word¬†_[elixir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir \"Elixir\")_¬†is derived). It was often considered to exist as a dry red powder (also known as¬†_al-kibrit al-ahmar_, red sulfur) made from a legendary stone‚Äîthe philosopher's stone. The elixir powder came to be regarded as a crucial component of transmutation by later Arab alchemists.\n\n\u003e In the 11th century, there was a debate among¬†[Muslim world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world \"Muslim world\")¬†[chemists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemist \"Chemist\")¬†on whether the transmutation of substances was possible. A leading opponent was the Persian polymath¬†[Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna \"Avicenna\")¬†(Ibn Sina), who discredited the theory of the transmutation of substances, stating, \"Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change.\"\n\n\u003e According to legend, the 13th-century scientist and philosopher,¬†[Albertus Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertus_Magnus \"Albertus Magnus\"), is said to have discovered the philosopher's stone. Magnus does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by \"transmutation\".","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.50640714Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Alices-Adventures-in-Wonderland":{"title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","content":"[[White Rabbit]] ","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.50640714Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Aragonite":{"title":"Aragonite","content":"One of the three most common naturally occurring #crystal forms of calcium carbonate ([[CaCO3]]) \n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.50640714Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Aster-flower":{"title":"Aster flower","content":"#aster \nMeans [[Star]] in Greek/Latin\n\nGenus of #flower with star shapes\nAlso called [[Michaelmas]] dasies\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.50640714Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Asterisk":{"title":"Asterisk","content":"#aster","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.50640714Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Asterism":{"title":"Asterism","content":"#aster \n[[Star]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.50640714Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Asterix-satellite":{"title":"Asterix satellite","content":"#aster\n#satellite","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.50640714Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Asterix-series":{"title":"Asterix series","content":"#aster \nComes from [[Asterisk]] meaning little [[Star]] #aster\n[[Obelix]] \n[[Asterix satellite]] - named after series\n[[-rix -rex suffix]] \n[[Gothic]] names have -ic suffix\n#Greek names have -os or -es suffix\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.50640714Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Asteroid-Lindgren":{"title":"Asteroid Lindgren","content":"#asteroid\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.50640714Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Astrid-Lindgren":{"title":"Astrid Lindgren","content":"#aster \nCreator of [[Pippi Longstocking]]\nOn 20 [[Swedish Krona]] note\n[[Asteroid Lindgren]] named after her\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.50640714Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Astronomical-Units":{"title":"Astronomical Units","content":"#aster ","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.50640714Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Au":{"title":"Au","content":"Symbol for [[Gold]]\nCan also be [[Astronomical Units]]","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.50640714Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Byzantine-Empire":{"title":"Byzantine Empire","content":"[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire \"Byzantine Empire\")\n\n### Music\n\u003e The ecclesiastical forms of¬†[[Byzantine Music]]‚Äîcomposed to Greek texts as ceremonial, festival, or church music‚Äîare today the most well-known forms.

Kervran was born in¬†[Quimper, Finist√®re](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quimper,_Finist%C3%A8re \"Quimper, Finist√®re\")¬†(Brittany), and received a degree as an engineer in 1925. In World War II he was part of the¬†[French Resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Resistance \"French Resistance\").\n\n\u003e Kervran proposed that¬†[nuclear transmutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation)¬†occurs in living organisms, which he called \"biological transmutation\". He made this claim after doing an experiment with chickens which he believed showed that they were generating calcium in their [[egg shells]] while there was no calcium in their food or soil. He had no known scientific explanation for it. Such transmutations are not possible according to known¬†[physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics \"Physics\"),¬†[chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry \"Chemistry\"), and¬†[biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology \"Biology\"). Proponents of biological transmutations fall outside mainstream¬†[physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics \"Physics\")¬†and are not part of accepted scientific discourse.\n\n## Biological transmutation[]\n\u003e In the 1960s, Louis Kervran claimed to have conducted experiments and studies demonstrating violations of the¬†[law of conservation of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_conservation_of_mass \"Law of conservation of mass\")¬†by biological systems, according to which the amount of each chemical element is preserved in all chemical reactions. He claimed that organisms can transmute potassium into calcium by¬†[nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion \"Nuclear fusion\")¬†in the course of making an egg shell:\n\n  \n\u003e \u003csub\u003e19\u003c/sub\u003eK  + \u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003eH  ¬†‚Üí \u003csub\u003e20\u003c/sub\u003eCa  \n\n\u003e Since biological systems do not contain mechanisms to produce the speed, temperature, and pressure necessary for such reactions, even for extremely short periods of time, this contradicts basic physical laws.\n\n\u003e Kervran said that his work was supported by prior studies and by reports of industrial accidents involving carbon monoxide. Kervran said that¬†[enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme \"Enzyme\")¬†can facilitate biological transmutations using the¬†[weak nuclear force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_nuclear_force \"Weak nuclear force\"), by what he called \"neutral currents.\" His response to criticism was to claim that¬†[physical laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law \"Physical law\")¬†do not apply to biological reactions, which contradicts the mainstream understanding that physical laws apply for all scales and conditions.\n\n\u003e The alleged transmutations are claimed to resemble¬†[cold fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion \"Cold fusion\"). There is currently no accepted theoretical model which would predict cold fusion to occur.\n\n\u003e In 1993, Kervran was awarded a parodic¬†[Ig Nobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel \"Ig Nobel\")¬†prize in Physics due to his \"improbable research\" in biological transmutation.

As the child grows, Proteus builds an¬†[[Incubator]]¬†for it to grow in once it is born. During the night, one month later and beneath a tent-like structure, Susan gives birth to the child with Proteus's help.

Susan damages the machine, causing it to open. The being menacingly rises from the machine only to topple over, apparently helpless.

In his opinion, \"That the [Egyptians knew of it and used it seems certain.\"\n\n\u003eFrom before the beginning of these theories, other historians and mathematicians have proposed alternative theories for the pyramid designs that are not related to any use of the golden ratio, and are instead based on purely rational slopes that only approximate the golden ratio.

Stones form in the kidney when¬†[minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral \"Mineral\")¬†in¬†[urine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine \"Urine\")¬†are at high concentration. The¬†[diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis \"Medical diagnosis\")¬†is usually based on symptoms,¬†[urine testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinalysis \"Urinalysis\"), and¬†[medical imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging \"Medical imaging\").¬†[Blood tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test \"Blood test\")¬†may also be useful.

Reducing oxalate absorption decreases kidney stone risk in susceptible people. Because of this, some doctors recommend increasing dairy intake so that its calcium content will serve as an oxalate binder.¬†Taking calcium citrate tablets during or after meals containing high oxalate foods may be useful if dietary calcium cannot be increased by other means as in those with lactose intolerance. The preferred calcium supplement for people at risk of stone formation is calcium citrate, as opposed to [[CaCO3|Calcium Carbonate]], because it helps to increase urinary citrate excretion.\n\n\u003e Differing generalizations regarding effects of pH on formation of silicate uroliths may be found. In this connection, it may be noted that under some circumstances, [[CaCO3|Calcium Carbonate]] accompanies silica in siliceous uroliths.\n\n\u003e Stones that are large enough to fill out the renal calyces are called¬†#staghorn stones¬†and are composed of¬†[[Struvite]]¬†in a vast majority of cases, which forms only in the presence of¬†[[Urease]]. Other forms that can possibly grow to become staghorn stones are those composed of cystine, calcium oxalate monohydrate, and uric acid.","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.562407152Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/Leonardo-DiCaprio":{"title":"Leonardo DiCaprio","content":"[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio \"Leonardo DiCaprio\")\n[[Titanic (1997 film)]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.562407152Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/Little-Fluffy-Clouds":{"title":"Little Fluffy Clouds","content":"[[Clouds]]\n[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Fluffy_Clouds \"Little Fluffy Clouds\")\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.562407152Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/Lovebites":{"title":"Lovebites","content":"#Band \n#Love \n [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovebites_(band) \"Lovebites (band)\")\n The #Resurrection arc of¬†[[Phoenix (manga)|Phoenix]]¬†inspired the lyrical theme of the 2018 song \"[M.D.O.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwork_Immortality \"Clockwork Immortality\")\" by heavy metal band¬†[[Lovebites]].

System 7 have a special relationship with Japan, and have been closely associated with the development of live dance music there. As an extension to this special spiritual connection, System 7 played as the only electronic dance music act at the World Festival of Sacred Music at Itsukujima shrine on¬†[Miyajima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itsukushima_Shrine \"Itsukushima Shrine\")¬†in 2001, and also offered a¬†_h≈çn≈ç_¬†(dedicatory) performance at Tenkawa-Daibenzaiten-sha (Tenkawa shrine) in Nara in 2013. In 2006 they were approached by Rumiko Tezuka, the daughter of famed manga pioneer¬†[Osamu Tezuka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Tezuka \"Osamu Tezuka\"), to see if they were interested in making musical interpretations of her father's¬†[[Phoenix (manga)]]¬†manga graphic novels. Rumiko had first become interested in System 7 after seeing them perform at the Miyajima festival. This project excited System 7 and it led directly to their album¬†Phoenix (released in Japan in 2007), which became their biggest selling album in Japan and also produced their successful Japanese single Hinotori (which means bird of fire). The phoenix theme, with Rumiko Tezuka's endorsement, continued with System 7's album and tour collaboration with Japanese band¬†[Rovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovo \"Rovo\"), which was titled¬†_Phoenix Rising_, and also featured Rovo's live rock re-interpretation of the track Hinotori.

Various historical figures, such as¬†[Taira no Kiyomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taira_no_Kiyomori \"Taira no Kiyomori\"), appear as major and minor characters. Although the character of Gao (from¬†_Ho-≈ç_) appears as a 400-year-old hermit and thus links¬†_Ranse-hen_¬†to the rest of the series, this particular arc stands out for its much more naturalistic approach, with next to no fantasy elements in it (except for those used for comedic effect, such as telephones in the 12th century). The Viz (English) edition is entitled¬†_Civil War_¬†and is split into two volumes, with¬†_Robe of Feathers_¬†included as an appendix to the second volume.\n\n#Life¬†(ÁîüÂëΩÁ∑®,¬†_seimei-hen_)\n\nPublished in¬†_Manga Sh≈çnen_, 1980.

He then escapes to Japan where he becomes the feudal lord Inugami and becomes caught in the middle of the¬†[Jinshin War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinshin_War \"Jinshin War\"), as well as joining a greater battle between supernatural forces and time-travelling to a bleak future world ruled by a theocracy that claimed to have captured the Phoenix. This chapter stands in stark contrast to the earlier historical Phoenix stories, which tended to de-mythologize the mythical characters therein, for instance in¬†_Dawn_, many¬†[Shinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto \"Shinto\")¬†gods are portrayed as mere humans. In this chapter, however, a wide variety of mythical creatures are shown fighting against¬†[Bodhisattva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva \"Bodhisattva\").\n\n\n\u003e The #Resurrection arc of¬†_Phoenix_¬†inspired the lyrical theme of the 2018 song \"[M.D.O.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwork_Immortality \"Clockwork Immortality\")\" by heavy metal band¬†[[Lovebites]]. In celebration of what would have been Tezuka's 90th birthday, Evil Line Records released the compilation album¬†_New Gene, Inspired from Phoenix_¬†on October 30, 2019.

They are potentiated by alkaline urine and high magnesium excretion (high magnesium/plant-based diets). They also are potentiated by a specific urinary protein in domestic cats.\n\n\u003eStruvite readily forms in alkaline conditions where its constituent ions are present. In nature, it forms primarily in areas associated with organic matter decomposition, including¬†[guano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guano \"Guano\")¬†deposits, basaltic caves, and¬†[marshlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshland \"Marshland\"). Similar conditions are found when human bladders are infected by urease-producing bacteria, when wastewater is treated, etc.\n\n\u003e Struvite is occasionally found in canned seafood, where its appearance is that of small glass slivers, objectionable to consumers for aesthetic reasons but of no health consequence. A simple test can differentiate struvite from glass.\n\n### Struvite kidney stones\n\u003e Struvite precipitates in alkaline¬†[urine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine \"Urine\"), forming¬†[kidney stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stones \"Kidney stones\"). Struvite is the most common mineral found in urinary tract stones in dogs, and is found also in urinary tract stones of cats and humans. Struvite stones are potentiated by¬†[bacterial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial \"Bacterial\")¬†infection that hydrolyzes¬†[urea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea \"Urea\")¬†to¬†[ammonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium \"Ammonium\")¬†and raises urine¬†[pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH \"PH\")¬†to neutral or alkaline values.

The protein¬†[cauxin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauxin \"Cauxin\"), a protein excreted in large amounts in cat urine that acts to produce a feline pheromone, has recently been found to cause nucleation of struvite crystals in a model system containing the ions necessary to form struvite. This may explain some of the excess struvite production in domestic cats. In the past, surgery has been required to remove struvite uroliths in cats; today, special acidifying low magnesium diets may be used to dissolve sterile struvite stones.\n\n\u003e Upper urinary tract stones that involve the renal pelvis and extend into at least 2 calyces are classified as staghorn calculi.

The Orb have maintained their signature¬†#science-fiction [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_science_fiction_themes \"List of science fiction themes\")¬†aesthetic despite numerous personnel changes, including the departure of Cauty and members¬†[Kris Weston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Weston \"Kris Weston\"), Andy Falconer,¬†[Simon Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Phillips_(producer) \"Simon Phillips (producer)\"), Nick Burton, and¬†[Andy Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hughes \"Andy Hughes\"). Paterson has been the only permanent member, continuing to work as the Orb with Swiss-German producer¬†[Thomas Fehlmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fehlmann \"Thomas Fehlmann\"), and later, with¬†[Martin \"Youth\" Glover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_%22Youth%22_Glover \"Martin \"Youth\" Glover\"), bassist of¬†[Killing Joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Joke_(band) \"Killing Joke (band)\"). Paterson's unauthorised use of¬†[other artists' works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music) \"Sampling (music)\")¬†has led to multiple disputes, most notably with¬†[Rickie Lee Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Lee_Jones \"Rickie Lee Jones\").\n\n\u003eDuring their live shows in the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and other digital media. Featuring colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery, their performances often incited comparisons to¬†[[Pink Floyd]] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd \"Pink Floyd\"), whose guitarist,¬†[David Gilmour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gilmour \"David Gilmour\"), later collaborated with them on the album¬†[[Metallic Spheres (album)]] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_Spheres \"Metallic Spheres\")_¬†in 2010.\n\n\u003eTheir sixteenth studio album,¬†_[Abolition of the Royal Familia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_the_Royal_Familia \"Abolition of the Royal Familia\")_, was released on 27 March 2020 by¬†[Cooking Vinyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_Vinyl \"Cooking Vinyl\").\n\n\u003e [Alex Paterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Paterson \"Alex Paterson\")¬†began his music career in the early 1980s as a¬†[roadie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadie \"Roadie\")¬†for the¬†[post-punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk \"Post-punk\")¬†rock band¬†[Killing Joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Joke \"Killing Joke\"), for whom his childhood friend¬†[Martin \"Youth\" Glover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Glover \"Martin Glover\")¬†played bass. Having left Killing Joke's employ, in 1986 Paterson became an A\u0026R man. Paterson and Youth shared a flat in¬†[Battersea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battersea \"Battersea\")¬†and¬†[Jimmy Cauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Cauty \"Jimmy Cauty\"), Youth's former bandmate from¬†[Brilliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_(band) \"Brilliant (band)\"), was a regular visitor. Paterson and Cauty began DJing and producing music together under the name the Orb. Their first release was a 1988¬†[acid house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_house \"Acid house\")¬†anthem track, \"Tripping on Sunshine\", released on Youth's compilation album¬†_[Eternity Project One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity_Project_One \"Eternity Project One\")_. The following year, the Orb released the¬†_[Kiss EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(The_Orb_EP) \"Kiss (The Orb EP)\")_, a four-track¬†[EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play \"Extended play\")¬†based on samples from New York City's¬†[KISS FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRKS \"WRKS\"). It was released on Paterson and Glover's new record label¬†[[WAU! Mr. Modo Records]] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAU!_Mr._Modo_Records \"WAU! Mr. Modo Records\"), which they created out of a desire to maintain financial independence from larger record labels. After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as \"really shit drum sounds\", the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by removing the percussion tracks. Paterson and Cauty began DJing in London and landed a deal for the Orb to play the¬†[chill out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chill_out_music \"Chill out music\")¬†room at London nightclub¬†[Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_(nightclub) \"Heaven (nightclub)\"). Resident DJ¬†[Paul Oakenfold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Oakenfold \"Paul Oakenfold\")¬†brought in the duo as ambient DJs for his \"The Land of Oz\" event at Heaven. Though the Orb's Monday night performances had only several hardcore followers initially, their chill-out room act grew popular over the course of their six-month stay to the point that the room was often packed with around 100¬†people. The Orb's performances became most popular among weary DJs and clubbers seeking solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor. The Orb built up melodies using¬†[multitrack recordings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitrack_recording \"Multitrack recording\")¬†linked to multiple¬†[record decks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_deck \"Record deck\")¬†and a¬†[mixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console \"Mixing console\"). The group incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and¬†BBC sound effects ([[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]])¬†into the act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as \"[Sue√±o Latino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue%C3%B1o_Latino \"Sue√±o Latino\")\". Though the group used a variety of samples, they avoided heavy rhythm and drums so that the intended ambient atmosphere was not disrupted. Most often, the group played¬†[dub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_music \"Dub music\")¬†and other¬†[[Chill-out music]], which it described as ambient house for the E generation.\n\n\u003e Throughout 1989 the Orb, along with Youth, developed a¬†[music production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_production \"Music production\")¬†style that incorporated¬†[ambient music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music \"Ambient music\")¬†with a diverse array of¬†[samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music) \"Sampling (music)\")¬†and recordings. The British music press later labelled the music¬†[ambient house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_house \"Ambient house\"). The culmination of the group's musical work came toward the end of the same year when they recorded a session for¬†[John Peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel \"John Peel\")¬†on¬†[[BBC Radio 1]]. The track, then known as \"Loving You,\" was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from¬†[science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction \"Science fiction\")¬†radio plays, nature sounds, and¬†[[Minnie Riperton]] 's \"[[Lovin' You]]\". For its release as a single on the record label¬†[Big Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Life \"Big Life\"), the Orb changed the title to \"[[A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld]]. Upon the single's release, Riperton's management forced Big Life to remove the unlicensed Riperton sample, ensuring that only the initial first-week release of the single contained the original vocals of Minnie Riperton; subsequent pressings used vocals from a sound-alike. Despite its running time of 22 minutes, the sample-laden single reached #78 on the¬†[British singles charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_singles_chart \"UK singles chart\"). Soon thereafter, the Orb were commissioned by¬†[Dave Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Stewart \"David A. Stewart\")¬†to remix his top-20 single \"[Lily Was Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Was_Here \"Lily Was Here\")\". The group obliged and were soon offered several more remix jobs from artists including¬†[Erasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure \"Erasure\")¬†and¬†[[System 7 (band)]].\n\n...\n\n\u003e Following the split, Paterson began working with Youth on the track \"[[Little Fluffy Clouds]]\". The group incorporated samples from¬†[Steve Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich \"Steve Reich\")'s¬†_[Electric Counterpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Counterpoint \"Electric Counterpoint\")_. The signature of the piece centres around the repeated phrases sampled from the voice of singer/songwriter¬†[Rickie Lee Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Lee_Jones \"Rickie Lee Jones\"), her spaced-out childlike ramble taken from a promotional CD released by Geffen Records for her 1989 album,¬†_[Flying Cowboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Cowboys \"Flying Cowboys\")_. In it she muses on the picturesque images of clouds from her Arizona childhood.\n\n...\n\n\u003e Also in the summer of 1994 the Orb provided music for The Jupiter Collision, the BBC's brief info series about the [[Comet Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy 9|Shoemaker-Levy]] comet.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.562407152Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/The-Sun":{"title":"The Sun","content":"[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.562407152Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/The-Who":{"title":"The Who","content":"#Band\n#Who\n[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who \"The Who\")\n ","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.562407152Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/Titanic-1997-film":{"title":"Titanic (1997 film)","content":"[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film))\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.562407152Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/Titans":{"title":"Titans","content":"#Greek\n[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(mythology) \"Titan (mythology)\")\n\u003e In¬†[Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology \"Greek mythology\"), the¬†**Titans**¬†([Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language \"Ancient Greek language\"):¬†Œø·º± Œ§·øëœÑ·æ∂ŒΩŒµœÇ,¬†_hoi Tƒ´t√¢nes_,¬†[singular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number \"Grammatical number\"):¬†·ΩÅ Œ§·øëœÑ·æ±ÃÅŒΩ, -ŒÆŒΩ,¬†_ho Tƒ´t√¢n_) were the pre-Olympian gods.

Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson, then both former members of electronic music project Unit Delta Plus, joined Vorhaus to form the band.\n\n\u003eAn Electric Storm\nIn June 1969 White Noise released the groundbreaking album An Electric Storm on Island Records. The album was created using a variety of tape manipulation techniques, and used the first British synthesizer, the EMS Synthi VCS3. Amongst many oddities, the first track on the album, Love Without Sound ( #love ) , employed sped-up tape edits of Vorhaus playing the double bass to create violin and cello sounds. Although not initially commercially successful for Island, the album is now considered an important and influential album in the development of electronic music, namechecked by contemporary artists like [[The Orb]] and Julian Cope, influencing contemporary acts such as Broadcast, [[Add N to (X)]], and Secret Chiefs 3. Peter Kember of Spacemen 3 included 'Firebird' on his 2004 curated compilation Spacelines.\n\n\n#III \n\u003e _White Noise 2-III-IV-V \nFollowing the departure of Derbyshire and Hodgson, to pursue other projects, Vorhaus released a second album, the largely instrumental¬†_White Noise 2 - Concerto for Synthesizer_¬†on¬†[Virgin Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Records \"Virgin Records\")¬†in 1974. It was recorded in his own studio in¬†[Camden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Camden \"London Borough of Camden\"), North London. The album further utilized the¬†[EMS VCS 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMS_VCS_3 \"EMS VCS 3\"), as well as prototype¬†[sequencers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_sequencer \"Music sequencer\"). A third album, the single track ' #space fantasy'¬†_White Noise III - Re-Entry_¬†was released by Pulse Records in 1980. A further two albums were released, the atmospheric¬†_White Noise IV - Inferno_¬†(AMP Music) (1990) incorporated the use of samples, and¬†_White Noise V - Sound Mind_¬†(AMP Music; 2000), an experiment in what Vorhaus called \"[dark ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_ambient \"Dark ambient\")\".\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.562407152Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/XLVI-CCIV":{"title":"XLVI CCIV","content":"#Num46204\n#Num46 \n#Num204\n\n![[Steg XLVI CCIV.png]]","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.562407152Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/anima-mundi":{"title":"anima mundi","content":" [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_mundi \"Anima mundi\")\n #Greek\n\u003e The¬†_**anima mundi**_¬†([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek \"Ancient Greek\"):¬†œàœÖœá·Ω¥ Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÖ,¬†_psych√® k√≥smou_) or¬†**world soul**¬†is, according to several systems of thought, an intrinsic connection between all living beings, which relates to the world in much the same way as the¬†[soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_(spirit) \"Soul (spirit)\")¬†is connected to the human body.\n\n\u003e Although the concept of the¬†_anima mundi_¬†originated in¬†[classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity \"Classical antiquity\"), similar ideas can be found in the thoughts of later European philosophers such as those of¬†[Baruch Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza \"Baruch Spinoza\"),¬†[Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz \"Gottfried Leibniz\"),¬†[Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant \"Immanuel Kant\"),¬†[Friedrich Schelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schelling \"Friedrich Schelling\"), and¬†[Georg W.F.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T01:02:41.566407153Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
