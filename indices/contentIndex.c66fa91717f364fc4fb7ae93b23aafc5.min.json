Byzantine and¬†[Muslim alchemists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy_and_chemistry_in_medieval_Islam \"Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam\")¬†were fascinated by the concept of metal transmutation and attempted to carry out the process. The eighth-century¬†[Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim \"Muslim\")¬†alchemist¬†[Jabir ibn Hayyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabir_ibn_Hayyan \"Jabir ibn Hayyan\")¬†([Latinized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin \"Latin\")¬†as¬†_Geber_) analyzed each classical element in terms of the four basic qualities. Fire was both hot and dry, earth cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air hot and moist. He theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them interior and two exterior. From this premise, it was reasoned that the transmutation of one metal into another could be effected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. This change would be mediated by a substance, which came to be called¬†_xerion_¬†in Greek and¬†_al-iksir_¬†in Arabic (from which the word¬†_[elixir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir \"Elixir\")_¬†is derived). It was often considered to exist as a dry red powder (also known as¬†_al-kibrit al-ahmar_, red sulfur) made from a legendary stone‚Äîthe philosopher's stone. The elixir powder came to be regarded as a crucial component of transmutation by later Arab alchemists.\n\n\u003e In the 11th century, there was a debate among¬†[Muslim world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world \"Muslim world\")¬†[chemists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemist \"Chemist\")¬†on whether the transmutation of substances was possible. A leading opponent was the Persian polymath¬†[Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna \"Avicenna\")¬†(Ibn Sina), who discredited the theory of the transmutation of substances, stating, \"Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change.\"\n\n\u003e According to legend, the 13th-century scientist and philosopher,¬†[Albertus Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertus_Magnus \"Albertus Magnus\"), is said to have discovered the philosopher's stone. Magnus does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by \"transmutation\".","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.518345251Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Alices-Adventures-in-Wonderland":{"title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","content":"[[White Rabbit]] ","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.518345251Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Aragonite":{"title":"Aragonite","content":"One of the three most common naturally occurring #crystal forms of calcium carbonate ([[CaCO3]]) \n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.518345251Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Aster-flower":{"title":"Aster flower","content":"#aster \nMeans [[Star]] in Greek/Latin\n\nGenus of #flower with star shapes\nAlso called [[Michaelmas]] dasies\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.518345251Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Asterisk":{"title":"Asterisk","content":"#aster","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.518345251Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Asterism":{"title":"Asterism","content":"#aster \n[[Star]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.518345251Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Asterix-satellite":{"title":"Asterix satellite","content":"#aster\n#satellite","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.518345251Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Asterix-series":{"title":"Asterix series","content":"#aster \nComes from [[Asterisk]] meaning little [[Star]] #aster\n[[Obelix]] \n[[Asterix satellite]] - named after series\n[[-rix -rex suffix]] \n[[Gothic]] names have -ic suffix\n#Greek names have -os or -es suffix\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.518345251Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Asteroid-Lindgren":{"title":"Asteroid Lindgren","content":"#asteroid\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.518345251Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Astrid-Lindgren":{"title":"Astrid Lindgren","content":"#aster \nCreator of [[Pippi Longstocking]]\nOn 20 [[Swedish Krona]] note\n[[Asteroid Lindgren]] named after her\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.518345251Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Astronomical-Units":{"title":"Astronomical Units","content":"#aster ","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.518345251Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Au":{"title":"Au","content":"Symbol for [[Gold]]\nCan also be [[Astronomical Units]]","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.518345251Z","tags":[]},"/T2E/Byzantine-Empire":{"title":"Byzantine Empire","content":"[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire \"Byzantine Empire\")\n\n### Music\n\u003e The ecclesiastical forms of¬†[[Byzantine Music]]‚Äîcomposed to Greek texts as ceremonial, festival, or church music‚Äîare today the most well-known forms.

Such transmutations are not possible according to known¬†[physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics \"Physics\"),¬†[chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry \"Chemistry\"), and¬†[biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology \"Biology\").

He claimed that organisms can transmute potassium into calcium by¬†[nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion \"Nuclear fusion\")¬†in the course of making an egg shell:\n\n  \n\u003e \u003csub\u003e19\u003c/sub\u003eK  + \u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003eH  ¬†‚Üí \u003csub\u003e20\u003c/sub\u003eCa  \n\n\u003e Since biological systems do not contain mechanisms to produce the speed, temperature, and pressure necessary for such reactions, even for extremely short periods of time, this contradicts basic physical laws.\n\n\u003e Kervran said that his work was supported by prior studies and by reports of industrial accidents involving carbon monoxide. Kervran said that¬†[enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme \"Enzyme\")¬†can facilitate biological transmutations using the¬†[weak nuclear force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_nuclear_force \"Weak nuclear force\"), by what he called \"neutral currents.\" His response to criticism was to claim that¬†[physical laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law \"Physical law\")¬†do not apply to biological reactions, which contradicts the mainstream understanding that physical laws apply for all scales and conditions.\n\n\u003e The alleged transmutations are claimed to resemble¬†[cold fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion \"Cold fusion\"). There is currently no accepted theoretical model which would predict cold fusion to occur.\n\n\u003e In 1993, Kervran was awarded a parodic¬†[Ig Nobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel \"Ig Nobel\")¬†prize in Physics due to his \"improbable research\" in biological transmutation.

In his opinion, \"That the [Egyptians knew of it and used it seems certain.\"\n\n\u003eFrom before the beginning of these theories, other historians and mathematicians have proposed alternative theories for the pyramid designs that are not related to any use of the golden ratio, and are instead based on purely rational slopes that only approximate the golden ratio.

Stones form in the kidney when¬†[minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral \"Mineral\")¬†in¬†[urine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine \"Urine\")¬†are at high concentration. The¬†[diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis \"Medical diagnosis\")¬†is usually based on symptoms,¬†[urine testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinalysis \"Urinalysis\"), and¬†[medical imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging \"Medical imaging\").¬†[Blood tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test \"Blood test\")¬†may also be useful.

Reducing oxalate absorption decreases kidney stone risk in susceptible people. Because of this, some doctors recommend increasing dairy intake so that its calcium content will serve as an oxalate binder.¬†Taking calcium citrate tablets during or after meals containing high oxalate foods may be useful if dietary calcium cannot be increased by other means as in those with lactose intolerance. The preferred calcium supplement for people at risk of stone formation is calcium citrate, as opposed to [[CaCO3|Calcium Carbonate]], because it helps to increase urinary citrate excretion.\n\n\u003e Differing generalizations regarding effects of pH on formation of silicate uroliths may be found. In this connection, it may be noted that under some circumstances, [[CaCO3|Calcium Carbonate]] accompanies silica in siliceous uroliths.\n\n\u003e Stones that are large enough to fill out the renal calyces are called¬†#staghorn stones¬†and are composed of¬†[[Struvite]]¬†in a vast majority of cases, which forms only in the presence of¬†[[Urease]]. Other forms that can possibly grow to become staghorn stones are those composed of cystine, calcium oxalate monohydrate, and uric acid.","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.598345986Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/Leonardo-DiCaprio":{"title":"Leonardo DiCaprio","content":"[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio \"Leonardo DiCaprio\")\n[[Titanic (1997 film)]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.598345986Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/Little-Fluffy-Clouds":{"title":"Little Fluffy Clouds","content":"[[Clouds]]\n[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Fluffy_Clouds \"Little Fluffy Clouds\")\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.598345986Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/Lovebites":{"title":"Lovebites","content":"#Band \n#Love \n [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovebites_(band) \"Lovebites (band)\")\n The #Resurrection arc of¬†[[Phoenix (manga)|Phoenix]]¬†inspired the lyrical theme of the 2018 song \"[M.D.O.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwork_Immortality \"Clockwork Immortality\")\" by heavy metal band¬†[[Lovebites]].

System 7 have a special relationship with Japan, and have been closely associated with the development of live dance music there. As an extension to this special spiritual connection, System 7 played as the only electronic dance music act at the World Festival of Sacred Music at Itsukujima shrine on¬†[Miyajima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itsukushima_Shrine \"Itsukushima Shrine\")¬†in 2001, and also offered a¬†_h≈çn≈ç_¬†(dedicatory) performance at Tenkawa-Daibenzaiten-sha (Tenkawa shrine) in Nara in 2013. In 2006 they were approached by Rumiko Tezuka, the daughter of famed manga pioneer¬†[Osamu Tezuka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Tezuka \"Osamu Tezuka\"), to see if they were interested in making musical interpretations of her father's¬†[[Phoenix (manga)]]¬†manga graphic novels. Rumiko had first become interested in System 7 after seeing them perform at the Miyajima festival. This project excited System 7 and it led directly to their album¬†Phoenix (released in Japan in 2007), which became their biggest selling album in Japan and also produced their successful Japanese single Hinotori (which means bird of fire). The phoenix theme, with Rumiko Tezuka's endorsement, continued with System 7's album and tour collaboration with Japanese band¬†[Rovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovo \"Rovo\"), which was titled¬†_Phoenix Rising_, and also featured Rovo's live rock re-interpretation of the track Hinotori.

The story is about a woodcutter named Benta and his childhood sweetheart, Obu, who are separated and caught up in the events of the¬†[Genpei War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genpei_War \"Genpei War\"). Various historical figures, such as¬†[Taira no Kiyomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taira_no_Kiyomori \"Taira no Kiyomori\"), appear as major and minor characters. Although the character of Gao (from¬†_Ho-≈ç_) appears as a 400-year-old hermit and thus links¬†_Ranse-hen_¬†to the rest of the series, this particular arc stands out for its much more naturalistic approach, with next to no fantasy elements in it (except for those used for comedic effect, such as telephones in the 12th century). The Viz (English) edition is entitled¬†_Civil War_¬†and is split into two volumes, with¬†_Robe of Feathers_¬†included as an appendix to the second volume.\n\n#Life¬†(ÁîüÂëΩÁ∑®,¬†_seimei-hen_)\n\nPublished in¬†_Manga Sh≈çnen_, 1980.

He then escapes to Japan where he becomes the feudal lord Inugami and becomes caught in the middle of the¬†[Jinshin War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinshin_War \"Jinshin War\"), as well as joining a greater battle between supernatural forces and time-travelling to a bleak future world ruled by a theocracy that claimed to have captured the Phoenix. This chapter stands in stark contrast to the earlier historical Phoenix stories, which tended to de-mythologize the mythical characters therein, for instance in¬†_Dawn_, many¬†[Shinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto \"Shinto\")¬†gods are portrayed as mere humans. In this chapter, however, a wide variety of mythical creatures are shown fighting against¬†[Bodhisattva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva \"Bodhisattva\").\n\n\n\u003e The #Resurrection arc of¬†_Phoenix_¬†inspired the lyrical theme of the 2018 song \"[M.D.O.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwork_Immortality \"Clockwork Immortality\")\" by heavy metal band¬†[[Lovebites]]. In celebration of what would have been Tezuka's 90th birthday, Evil Line Records released the compilation album¬†_New Gene, Inspired from Phoenix_¬†on October 30, 2019.

Urea-splitting organisms include¬†[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]],¬†_[Xanthomonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthomonas \"Xanthomonas\")_,¬†_[Pseudomonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas \"Pseudomonas\")_,¬†_[Klebsiella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella \"Klebsiella\")_,¬†_[Staphylococcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus \"Staphylococcus\")_, and¬†_[Mycoplasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma \"Mycoplasma\")_.\n\n\u003e Even in the absence of infection, accumulation of struvite crystals in the¬†[urinary bladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder \"Urinary bladder\")¬†is a problem frequently seen in¬†[housecats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat \"Cat\"), with symptoms including difficulty urinating (which may be mistaken for¬†[constipation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation \"Constipation\")) or blood in the urine ([hematuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria \"Hematuria\")). The protein¬†[cauxin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauxin \"Cauxin\"), a protein excreted in large amounts in cat urine that acts to produce a feline pheromone, has recently been found to cause nucleation of struvite crystals in a model system containing the ions necessary to form struvite. This may explain some of the excess struvite production in domestic cats. In the past, surgery has been required to remove struvite uroliths in cats; today, special acidifying low magnesium diets may be used to dissolve sterile struvite stones.\n\n\u003e Upper urinary tract stones that involve the renal pelvis and extend into at least 2 calyces are classified as staghorn calculi. Although all types of urinary stones can potentially form staghorn calculi, approximately 75% are composed of a struvite-carbonate-apatite matrix.","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.602346022Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/System-7-album":{"title":"System 7 (album)","content":"[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_7_(album))\n_**System 7**_¬†is the first studio¬†[album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album \"Album\")¬†by the¬†[dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music \"Dance music\")/[ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music \"Ambient music\")¬†band¬†[[System 7 (band)|System 7]]\n\nA somewhat different version was released in the¬†[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States \"United States\")¬†as¬†_**777**_¬†by 777 #Num777.

The Orb have maintained their signature¬†#science-fiction [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_science_fiction_themes \"List of science fiction themes\")¬†aesthetic despite numerous personnel changes, including the departure of Cauty and members¬†[Kris Weston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Weston \"Kris Weston\"), Andy Falconer,¬†[Simon Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Phillips_(producer) \"Simon Phillips (producer)\"), Nick Burton, and¬†[Andy Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hughes \"Andy Hughes\"). Paterson has been the only permanent member, continuing to work as the Orb with Swiss-German producer¬†[Thomas Fehlmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fehlmann \"Thomas Fehlmann\"), and later, with¬†[Martin \"Youth\" Glover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_%22Youth%22_Glover \"Martin \"Youth\" Glover\"), bassist of¬†[Killing Joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Joke_(band) \"Killing Joke (band)\"). Paterson's unauthorised use of¬†[other artists' works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music) \"Sampling (music)\")¬†has led to multiple disputes, most notably with¬†[Rickie Lee Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Lee_Jones \"Rickie Lee Jones\").\n\n\u003eDuring their live shows in the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and other digital media. Featuring colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery, their performances often incited comparisons to¬†[[Pink Floyd]] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd \"Pink Floyd\"), whose guitarist,¬†[David Gilmour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gilmour \"David Gilmour\"), later collaborated with them on the album¬†[[Metallic Spheres (album)]] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_Spheres \"Metallic Spheres\")_¬†in 2010.\n\n\u003eTheir sixteenth studio album,¬†_[Abolition of the Royal Familia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_the_Royal_Familia \"Abolition of the Royal Familia\")_, was released on 27 March 2020 by¬†[Cooking Vinyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_Vinyl \"Cooking Vinyl\").\n\n\u003e [Alex Paterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Paterson \"Alex Paterson\")¬†began his music career in the early 1980s as a¬†[roadie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadie \"Roadie\")¬†for the¬†[post-punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk \"Post-punk\")¬†rock band¬†[Killing Joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Joke \"Killing Joke\"), for whom his childhood friend¬†[Martin \"Youth\" Glover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Glover \"Martin Glover\")¬†played bass. Having left Killing Joke's employ, in 1986 Paterson became an A\u0026R man. Paterson and Youth shared a flat in¬†[Battersea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battersea \"Battersea\")¬†and¬†[Jimmy Cauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Cauty \"Jimmy Cauty\"), Youth's former bandmate from¬†[Brilliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_(band) \"Brilliant (band)\"), was a regular visitor. Paterson and Cauty began DJing and producing music together under the name the Orb. Their first release was a 1988¬†[acid house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_house \"Acid house\")¬†anthem track, \"Tripping on Sunshine\", released on Youth's compilation album¬†_[Eternity Project One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity_Project_One \"Eternity Project One\")_. The following year, the Orb released the¬†_[Kiss EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(The_Orb_EP) \"Kiss (The Orb EP)\")_, a four-track¬†[EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play \"Extended play\")¬†based on samples from New York City's¬†[KISS FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRKS \"WRKS\"). It was released on Paterson and Glover's new record label¬†[[WAU! Mr. Modo Records]] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAU!_Mr._Modo_Records \"WAU! Mr. Modo Records\"), which they created out of a desire to maintain financial independence from larger record labels. After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as \"really shit drum sounds\", the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by removing the percussion tracks. Paterson and Cauty began DJing in London and landed a deal for the Orb to play the¬†[chill out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chill_out_music \"Chill out music\")¬†room at London nightclub¬†[Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_(nightclub) \"Heaven (nightclub)\"). Resident DJ¬†[Paul Oakenfold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Oakenfold \"Paul Oakenfold\")¬†brought in the duo as ambient DJs for his \"The Land of Oz\" event at Heaven. Though the Orb's Monday night performances had only several hardcore followers initially, their chill-out room act grew popular over the course of their six-month stay to the point that the room was often packed with around 100¬†people. The Orb's performances became most popular among weary DJs and clubbers seeking solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor. The Orb built up melodies using¬†[multitrack recordings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitrack_recording \"Multitrack recording\")¬†linked to multiple¬†[record decks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_deck \"Record deck\")¬†and a¬†[mixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console \"Mixing console\"). The group incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and¬†BBC sound effects ([[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]])¬†into the act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as \"[Sue√±o Latino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue%C3%B1o_Latino \"Sue√±o Latino\")\". Though the group used a variety of samples, they avoided heavy rhythm and drums so that the intended ambient atmosphere was not disrupted. Most often, the group played¬†[dub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_music \"Dub music\")¬†and other¬†[[Chill-out music]], which it described as ambient house for the E generation.\n\n\u003e Throughout 1989 the Orb, along with Youth, developed a¬†[music production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_production \"Music production\")¬†style that incorporated¬†[ambient music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music \"Ambient music\")¬†with a diverse array of¬†[samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music) \"Sampling (music)\")¬†and recordings. The British music press later labelled the music¬†[ambient house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_house \"Ambient house\"). The culmination of the group's musical work came toward the end of the same year when they recorded a session for¬†[John Peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel \"John Peel\")¬†on¬†[[BBC Radio 1]]. The track, then known as \"Loving You,\" was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from¬†[science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction \"Science fiction\")¬†radio plays, nature sounds, and¬†[[Minnie Riperton]] 's \"[[Lovin' You]]\". For its release as a single on the record label¬†[Big Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Life \"Big Life\"), the Orb changed the title to \"[[A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld]]. Upon the single's release, Riperton's management forced Big Life to remove the unlicensed Riperton sample, ensuring that only the initial first-week release of the single contained the original vocals of Minnie Riperton; subsequent pressings used vocals from a sound-alike. Despite its running time of 22 minutes, the sample-laden single reached #78 on the¬†[British singles charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_singles_chart \"UK singles chart\"). Soon thereafter, the Orb were commissioned by¬†[Dave Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Stewart \"David A. Stewart\")¬†to remix his top-20 single \"[Lily Was Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Was_Here \"Lily Was Here\")\". The group obliged and were soon offered several more remix jobs from artists including¬†[Erasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure \"Erasure\")¬†and¬†[[System 7 (band)]].\n\n...\n\n\u003e Following the split, Paterson began working with Youth on the track \"[[Little Fluffy Clouds]]\". The group incorporated samples from¬†[Steve Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich \"Steve Reich\")'s¬†_[Electric Counterpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Counterpoint \"Electric Counterpoint\")_. The signature of the piece centres around the repeated phrases sampled from the voice of singer/songwriter¬†[Rickie Lee Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Lee_Jones \"Rickie Lee Jones\"), her spaced-out childlike ramble taken from a promotional CD released by Geffen Records for her 1989 album,¬†_[Flying Cowboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Cowboys \"Flying Cowboys\")_. In it she muses on the picturesque images of clouds from her Arizona childhood.\n\n...\n\n\u003e Also in the summer of 1994 the Orb provided music for The Jupiter Collision, the BBC's brief info series about the [[Comet Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy 9|Shoemaker-Levy]] comet.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.602346022Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/The-Sun":{"title":"The Sun","content":"[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.602346022Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/The-Who":{"title":"The Who","content":"#Band\n#Who\n[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who \"The Who\")\n ","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.602346022Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/Titanic-1997-film":{"title":"Titanic (1997 film)","content":"[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film))\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.602346022Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/Titans":{"title":"Titans","content":"#Greek\n[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(mythology) \"Titan (mythology)\")\n\u003e In¬†[Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology \"Greek mythology\"), the¬†**Titans**¬†([Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language \"Ancient Greek language\"):¬†Œø·º± Œ§·øëœÑ·æ∂ŒΩŒµœÇ,¬†_hoi Tƒ´t√¢nes_,¬†[singular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number \"Grammatical number\"):¬†·ΩÅ Œ§·øëœÑ·æ±ÃÅŒΩ, -ŒÆŒΩ,¬†_ho Tƒ´t√¢n_) were the pre-Olympian gods.

Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson, then both former members of electronic music project Unit Delta Plus, joined Vorhaus to form the band.\n\n\u003eAn Electric Storm\nIn June 1969 White Noise released the groundbreaking album An Electric Storm on Island Records. The album was created using a variety of tape manipulation techniques, and used the first British synthesizer, the EMS Synthi VCS3. Amongst many oddities, the first track on the album, Love Without Sound ( #love ) , employed sped-up tape edits of Vorhaus playing the double bass to create violin and cello sounds. Although not initially commercially successful for Island, the album is now considered an important and influential album in the development of electronic music, namechecked by contemporary artists like [[The Orb]] and Julian Cope, influencing contemporary acts such as Broadcast, [[Add N to (X)]], and Secret Chiefs 3. Peter Kember of Spacemen 3 included 'Firebird' on his 2004 curated compilation Spacelines.\n\n\n#III \n\u003e _White Noise 2-III-IV-V \nFollowing the departure of Derbyshire and Hodgson, to pursue other projects, Vorhaus released a second album, the largely instrumental¬†_White Noise 2 - Concerto for Synthesizer_¬†on¬†[Virgin Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Records \"Virgin Records\")¬†in 1974. It was recorded in his own studio in¬†[Camden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Camden \"London Borough of Camden\"), North London. The album further utilized the¬†[EMS VCS 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMS_VCS_3 \"EMS VCS 3\"), as well as prototype¬†[sequencers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_sequencer \"Music sequencer\").

A further two albums were released, the atmospheric¬†_White Noise IV - Inferno_¬†(AMP Music) (1990) incorporated the use of samples, and¬†_White Noise V - Sound Mind_¬†(AMP Music; 2000), an experiment in what Vorhaus called \"[dark ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_ambient \"Dark ambient\")\".\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.602346022Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/XLVI-CCIV":{"title":"XLVI CCIV","content":"#Num46204\n#Num46 \n#Num204\n\n![[Steg XLVI CCIV.png]]","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:35:51.602346022Z","tags":[]},"/T2F/anima-mundi":{"title":"anima mundi","content":" [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_mundi \"Anima mundi\")\n #Greek\n\u003e The¬†_**anima mundi**_¬†([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek \"Ancient Greek\"):¬†œàœÖœá·Ω¥ Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÖ,¬†_psych√® k√≥smou_) or¬†**world soul**¬†is, according to several systems of thought, an intrinsic connection between all living beings, which relates to the world in much the same way as the¬†[soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_(spirit) \"Soul (spirit)\")¬†is connected to the human body.\n\n\u003e Although the concept of the¬†_anima mundi_¬†originated in¬†[classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity \"Classical antiquity\"), similar ideas can be found in the thoughts of later European philosophers such as those of¬†[Baruch Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza \"Baruch Spinoza\"),¬†[Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz \"Gottfried Leibniz\"),¬†[Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant \"Immanuel Kant\"),¬†[Friedrich Schelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schelling \"Friedrich Schelling\"), and¬†[Georg W.F.
