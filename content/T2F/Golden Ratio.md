>German mathematician Simon Jacob (d. 1564) noted that [consecutive Fibonacci numbers converge to the golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio#Relationship_to_Fibonacci_and_Lucas_numbers)([[Fibonacci numbers]]); this was rediscovered by [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") in 1608. The first known [decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_fractions "Decimal fractions") approximation of the (inverse) golden ratio was stated as "about 0.6180340" in 1597 by [Michael Maestlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Maestlin "Michael Maestlin") of the [University of Tübingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_T%C3%BCbingen "University of Tübingen") in a letter to Kepler, his former student. The same year, Kepler wrote to Maestlin of the [Kepler triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_triangle "Kepler triangle"), which combines the golden ratio with the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem"). Kepler said of these:

> Geometry has two great treasures: one is the theorem of Pythagoras, the other the division of a line into extreme and mean #ratio. The first we may compare to a mass of [[gold]], the second we may call a precious #jewel.

>The [Great Pyramid of Giza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza "Great Pyramid of Giza") (constructed c. 2570 BC by [Hemiunu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiunu "Hemiunu")) exhibits the golden ratio according to various [pyramidologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramidology "Pyramidology"), including Charles Funck-Hellet. John F. Pile, interior design professor and historian, has claimed that [[Egypt]]ian architects sought the golden proportions without mathematical techniques and that it is common to see the 1.618:1 ratio, along with many other simpler geometrical concepts, in their architectural details, art, and everyday objects found in tombs. In his opinion, "That the [Egyptians knew of it and used it seems certain."

>From before the beginning of these theories, other historians and mathematicians have proposed alternative theories for the pyramid designs that are not related to any use of the golden ratio, and are instead based on purely rational slopes that only approximate the golden ratio. The Egyptians of those times apparently did not know the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem"); the only right triangle whose proportions they knew was the 3:4:5 triangle.
