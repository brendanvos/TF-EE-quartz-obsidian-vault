#Band
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Noise_(band))
> White Noise are an English experimental electronic music band formed in London in 1968, after American-born David Vorhaus, a classical bass player with a background in physics and electronic engineering, attended a lecture by Delia Derbyshire, a sound scientist at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]]. Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson, then both former members of electronic music project Unit Delta Plus, joined Vorhaus to form the band.

>An Electric Storm
In June 1969 White Noise released the groundbreaking album An Electric Storm on Island Records. The album was created using a variety of tape manipulation techniques, and used the first British synthesizer, the EMS Synthi VCS3. Amongst many oddities, the first track on the album, Love Without Sound ( #love ) , employed sped-up tape edits of Vorhaus playing the double bass to create violin and cello sounds. Although not initially commercially successful for Island, the album is now considered an important and influential album in the development of electronic music, namechecked by contemporary artists like [[The Orb]] and Julian Cope, influencing contemporary acts such as Broadcast, [[Add N to (X)]], and Secret Chiefs 3. Peter Kember of Spacemen 3 included 'Firebird' on his 2004 curated compilation Spacelines.

Following the departure of Derbyshire and Hodgson, to pursue other projects, Vorhaus released a second album, the largely instrumental _White Noise 2 - Concerto for Synthesizer_ on [Virgin Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Records "Virgin Records") in 1974. It was recorded in his own studio in [Camden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Camden "London Borough of Camden"), North London. The album further utilized the [EMS VCS 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMS_VCS_3 "EMS VCS 3"), as well as prototype [sequencers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_sequencer "Music sequencer"). A third album, the single track ' #space fantasy' _White Noise III - Re-Entry_ was released by Pulse Records in 1980. A further two albums were released, the atmospheric _White Noise IV - Inferno_ (AMP Music) (1990) incorporated the use of samples, and _White Noise V - Sound Mind_ (AMP Music; 2000), an experiment in what Vorhaus called "[dark ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_ambient "Dark ambient")".
