[[Stone]]

>Most stones form by a combination of [genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics "Genetics") and environmental factors. Risk factors include [high urine calcium levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercalciuria "Hypercalciuria"), [obesity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity "Obesity"), certain foods, some medications, [calcium supplements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_supplement "Calcium supplement"), [hyperparathyroidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparathyroidism "Hyperparathyroidism"), [gout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout "Gout") and not drinking enough fluids. Stones form in the kidney when [minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral "Mineral") in [urine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine "Urine") are at high concentration. The [diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis "Medical diagnosis") is usually based on symptoms, [urine testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinalysis "Urinalysis"), and [medical imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging "Medical imaging"). [Blood tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test "Blood test") may also be useful. Stones are typically classified by their location: nephrolithiasis (in the kidney), ureterolithiasis (in the [ureter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter "Ureter")), [cystolithiasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_stone "Bladder stone") (in the [bladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder "Urinary bladder")), or by [what they are made of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_composition "Chemical composition") ([calcium oxalate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_oxalate "Calcium oxalate"), [uric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid "Uric acid"), [[Struvite]]], [cystine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystine "Cystine")).

> Calcium binds with available oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby preventing its absorption into the bloodstream. Reducing oxalate absorption decreases kidney stone risk in susceptible people. Because of this, some doctors recommend increasing dairy intake so that its calcium content will serve as an oxalate binder. Taking calcium citrate tablets during or after meals containing high oxalate foods may be useful if dietary calcium cannot be increased by other means as in those with lactose intolerance. The preferred calcium supplement for people at risk of stone formation is calcium citrate, as opposed to [[CaCO3|Calcium Carbonate]], because it helps to increase urinary citrate excretion.

> Differing generalizations regarding effects of pH on formation of silicate uroliths may be found. In this connection, it may be noted that under some circumstances, [[CaCO3|Calcium Carbonate]] accompanies silica in siliceous uroliths.

> Stones that are large enough to fill out the renal calyces are called #staghorn stones and are composed of [[Struvite]] in a vast majority of cases, which forms only in the presence of [[Urease]]. Other forms that can possibly grow to become staghorn stones are those composed of cystine, calcium oxalate monohydrate, and uric acid.
