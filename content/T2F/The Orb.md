> Their influential 1991 debut album The Orb's [[Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld]]  pioneered the UK's nascent [ambient house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_house "Ambient house") movement, while its UK chart-topping follow-up _[U.F.Orb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.F.Orb "U.F.Orb")_ represented the genre's commercial peak.
> 
> Beginning as [ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music "Ambient music") and [dub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_music "Dub music") DJs in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London"), the Orb's early performances were inspired by electronic artists of the 1970s, most notably [[Brian Eno]] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno "Brian Eno"), [Cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_(band) "Cluster (band)"), and [Kraftwerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk "Kraftwerk"). The Orb have maintained their signature #science-fiction [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_science_fiction_themes "List of science fiction themes") aesthetic despite numerous personnel changes, including the departure of Cauty and members [Kris Weston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Weston "Kris Weston"), Andy Falconer, [Simon Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Phillips_(producer) "Simon Phillips (producer)"), Nick Burton, and [Andy Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hughes "Andy Hughes"). Paterson has been the only permanent member, continuing to work as the Orb with Swiss-German producer [Thomas Fehlmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fehlmann "Thomas Fehlmann"), and later, with [Martin "Youth" Glover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_%22Youth%22_Glover "Martin "Youth" Glover"), bassist of [Killing Joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Joke_(band) "Killing Joke (band)"). Paterson's unauthorised use of [other artists' works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music) "Sampling (music)") has led to multiple disputes, most notably with [Rickie Lee Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Lee_Jones "Rickie Lee Jones").

>During their live shows in the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and other digital media. Featuring colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery, their performances often incited comparisons to [[Pink Floyd]] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd "Pink Floyd"), whose guitarist, [David Gilmour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gilmour "David Gilmour"), later collaborated with them on the album [[Metallic Spheres (album)]] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_Spheres "Metallic Spheres")_ in 2010.

>Their sixteenth studio album, _[Abolition of the Royal Familia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_the_Royal_Familia "Abolition of the Royal Familia")_, was released on 27 March 2020 by [Cooking Vinyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_Vinyl "Cooking Vinyl").

> [Alex Paterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Paterson "Alex Paterson") began his music career in the early 1980s as a [roadie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadie "Roadie") for the [post-punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk "Post-punk") rock band [Killing Joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Joke "Killing Joke"), for whom his childhood friend [Martin "Youth" Glover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Glover "Martin Glover") played bass. Having left Killing Joke's employ, in 1986 Paterson became an A&R man. Paterson and Youth shared a flat in [Battersea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battersea "Battersea") and [Jimmy Cauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Cauty "Jimmy Cauty"), Youth's former bandmate from [Brilliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_(band) "Brilliant (band)"), was a regular visitor. Paterson and Cauty began DJing and producing music together under the name the Orb. Their first release was a 1988 [acid house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_house "Acid house") anthem track, "Tripping on Sunshine", released on Youth's compilation album _[Eternity Project One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity_Project_One "Eternity Project One")_. The following year, the Orb released the _[Kiss EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(The_Orb_EP) "Kiss (The Orb EP)")_, a four-track [EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play "Extended play") based on samples from New York City's [KISS FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRKS "WRKS"). It was released on Paterson and Glover's new record label [[WAU! Mr. Modo Records]] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAU!_Mr._Modo_Records "WAU! Mr. Modo Records"), which they created out of a desire to maintain financial independence from larger record labels. After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as "really shit drum sounds", the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by removing the percussion tracks. Paterson and Cauty began DJing in London and landed a deal for the Orb to play the [chill out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chill_out_music "Chill out music") room at London nightclub [Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_(nightclub) "Heaven (nightclub)"). Resident DJ [Paul Oakenfold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Oakenfold "Paul Oakenfold") brought in the duo as ambient DJs for his "The Land of Oz" event at Heaven. Though the Orb's Monday night performances had only several hardcore followers initially, their chill-out room act grew popular over the course of their six-month stay to the point that the room was often packed with around 100 people. The Orb's performances became most popular among weary DJs and clubbers seeking solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor. The Orb built up melodies using [multitrack recordings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitrack_recording "Multitrack recording") linked to multiple [record decks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_deck "Record deck") and a [mixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console "Mixing console"). The group incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and BBC sound effects ([[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]]) into the act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as "[Sueño Latino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue%C3%B1o_Latino "Sueño Latino")". Though the group used a variety of samples, they avoided heavy rhythm and drums so that the intended ambient atmosphere was not disrupted. Most often, the group played [dub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_music "Dub music") and other [[Chill-out music]], which it described as ambient house for the E generation.

> Throughout 1989 the Orb, along with Youth, developed a [music production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_production "Music production") style that incorporated [ambient music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music "Ambient music") with a diverse array of [samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music) "Sampling (music)") and recordings. The British music press later labelled the music [ambient house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_house "Ambient house"). The culmination of the group's musical work came toward the end of the same year when they recorded a session for [John Peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel "John Peel") on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The track, then known as "Loving You," was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") radio plays, nature sounds, and [[Minnie Riperton]] 's "[[Lovin' You]]". For its release as a single on the record label [Big Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Life "Big Life"), the Orb changed the title to "[[A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld]]. Upon the single's release, Riperton's management forced Big Life to remove the unlicensed Riperton sample, ensuring that only the initial first-week release of the single contained the original vocals of Minnie Riperton; subsequent pressings used vocals from a sound-alike. Despite its running time of 22 minutes, the sample-laden single reached #78 on the [British singles charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_singles_chart "UK singles chart"). Soon thereafter, the Orb were commissioned by [Dave Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Stewart "David A. Stewart") to remix his top-20 single "[Lily Was Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Was_Here "Lily Was Here")". The group obliged and were soon offered several more remix jobs from artists including [Erasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure "Erasure") and [[System 7 (band)]].

...

> Following the split, Paterson began working with Youth on the track "[[Little Fluffy Clouds]]". The group incorporated samples from [Steve Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich "Steve Reich")'s _[Electric Counterpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Counterpoint "Electric Counterpoint")_. The signature of the piece centres around the repeated phrases sampled from the voice of singer/songwriter [Rickie Lee Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Lee_Jones "Rickie Lee Jones"), her spaced-out childlike ramble taken from a promotional CD released by Geffen Records for her 1989 album, _[Flying Cowboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Cowboys "Flying Cowboys")_. In it she muses on the picturesque images of clouds from her Arizona childhood.

> Also in the summer of 1994 the Orb provided music for The Jupiter Collision, the BBC's brief info series about the [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy]] comet.
