> **Struvite** ([magnesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium "Magnesium") [ammonium phosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_phosphate "Ammonium phosphate")) is a [phosphate mineral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate_mineral "Phosphate mineral") with formula: NH4MgPO4·6H2O. Struvite crystallizes in the [orthorhombic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthorhombic "Orthorhombic") system as white to yellowish or brownish-white pyramidal crystals or in platy [mica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mica "Mica")-like forms. It is a soft mineral with [Mohs hardness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_hardness "Mohs hardness") of 1.5 to 2 and has a low [specific gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_gravity "Specific gravity") of 1.7. It is sparingly soluble in neutral and alkaline conditions, but readily soluble in acid.

> Struvite urinary stones and crystals form readily in the urine of animals and humans that are infected with [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia "Ammonia")-producing organisms. They are potentiated by alkaline urine and high magnesium excretion (high magnesium/plant-based diets). They also are potentiated by a specific urinary protein in domestic cats.

>Struvite readily forms in alkaline conditions where its constituent ions are present. In nature, it forms primarily in areas associated with organic matter decomposition, including [guano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guano "Guano") deposits, basaltic caves, and [marshlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshland "Marshland"). Similar conditions are found when human bladders are infected by urease-producing bacteria, when wastewater is treated, etc.

> Struvite is occasionally found in canned seafood, where its appearance is that of small glass slivers, objectionable to consumers for aesthetic reasons but of no health consequence. A simple test can differentiate struvite from glass.

### Struvite kidney stones
> Struvite precipitates in alkaline [urine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine "Urine"), forming [kidney stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stones "Kidney stones"). Struvite is the most common mineral found in urinary tract stones in dogs, and is found also in urinary tract stones of cats and humans. Struvite stones are potentiated by [bacterial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial "Bacterial") infection that hydrolyzes [urea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea "Urea") to [ammonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium "Ammonium") and raises urine [pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH "PH") to neutral or alkaline values. Urea-splitting organisms include [[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]], _[Xanthomonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthomonas "Xanthomonas")_, _[Pseudomonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas "Pseudomonas")_, _[Klebsiella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella "Klebsiella")_, _[Staphylococcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus "Staphylococcus")_, and _[Mycoplasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma "Mycoplasma")_.

> Even in the absence of infection, accumulation of struvite crystals in the [urinary bladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder "Urinary bladder") is a problem frequently seen in [housecats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat "Cat"), with symptoms including difficulty urinating (which may be mistaken for [constipation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation "Constipation")) or blood in the urine ([hematuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria "Hematuria")). The protein [cauxin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauxin "Cauxin"), a protein excreted in large amounts in cat urine that acts to produce a feline pheromone, has recently been found to cause nucleation of struvite crystals in a model system containing the ions necessary to form struvite. This may explain some of the excess struvite production in domestic cats. In the past, surgery has been required to remove struvite uroliths in cats; today, special acidifying low magnesium diets may be used to dissolve sterile struvite stones.

> Upper urinary tract stones that involve the renal pelvis and extend into at least 2 calyces are classified as staghorn calculi. Although all types of urinary stones can potentially form staghorn calculi, approximately 75% are composed of a struvite-carbonate-apatite matrix.
