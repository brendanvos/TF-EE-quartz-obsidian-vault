"**Doctorin' the Tardis**" is a [novelty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_record "Novelty record") [single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music) "Single (music)") by the Timelords ("Time Boy" and "Lord Rock", aliases of [Bill Drummond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Drummond "Bill Drummond") and [Jimmy Cauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Cauty "Jimmy Cauty"), better known as [the KLF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_KLF "The KLF")). The song is predominantly a [mash-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(music) "Mashup (music)") of the [[Doctor Who theme music]] and [Gary Glitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Glitter "Gary Glitter")'s "[Rock and Roll (Part Two)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_(Gary_Glitter_song) "Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)")" with sections from "[Blockbuster!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster! "Blockbuster!")" by [Sweet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sweet "The Sweet"). The single was not well received by critics but was a commercial success, hitting number one on the UK and New Zealand singles charts, and reaching the top 10 in Australia, Finland, Ireland and Norway.

The Timelords followed up their chart-topping record with a "how to have a number one" guide, _[The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manual "The Manual")_.
