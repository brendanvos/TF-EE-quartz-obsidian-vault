>Meyer-Eppler's student [Karlheinz Stockhausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen "Karlheinz Stockhausen") used [[Ring Modulation]] in 1956 for some sounds in _[Gesang der Jünglinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesang_der_J%C3%BCnglinge "Gesang der Jünglinge")_ and his realization score for _[Telemusik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemusik "Telemusik")_ (1966) also calls for it. Indeed, several entire compositions by Stockhausen are based around it, such as _[Mixtur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtur "Mixtur")_ (1964), one of the first compositions for orchestra and live electronics; _[Mikrophonie II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikrophonie_(Stockhausen) "Mikrophonie (Stockhausen)")_ (1965), where the sounds of choral voices are modulated with a [Hammond organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond_organ "Hammond organ"); _[Mantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra_(Stockhausen) "Mantra (Stockhausen)")_ (1970), where the sounds from two pianos are routed through ring modulators; and _Licht-Bilder_ (2002) from _[Sonntag aus Licht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonntag_aus_Licht "Sonntag aus Licht")_ (2003), which ring-modulates flute and trumpet. Other Stockhausen pieces employing [[Ring Modulation]] include _[Kontakte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kontakte "Kontakte")_ (1960),_Mikrophonie I_ (1964) [[Microphone]] ,[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_modulation#cite_note-Roads-1) _[Hymnen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymnen "Hymnen")_ (1969), _[Prozession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prozession "Prozession")_ (1967), and _[Kurzwellen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurzwellen)_ (1968).

>Stockhausen later wrote, describing this period in his compositional work, "The first revolution occurred from 1952/53 as _[[Musique Concrète]]_, _electronic tape music_, and _[[Space Music]]_, entailing composition with transformers, generators, [[Ring Modulation|Modulators]], magnetophones, etc; the integration of _all_ [[Concrete]] and abstract (synthetic) sound possibilities (also all noises), and the controlled projection of sound in space".

...

> Other large works by Stockhausen from this decade include the orchestral _[Trans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_(Stockhausen) "Trans (Stockhausen)")_ (1971) and two music-theatre compositions utilizing the _Tierkreis_ melodies: _[Musik im Bauch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musik_im_Bauch "Musik im Bauch")_ ("Music in the Belly") for six percussionists (1975), and the science-fiction "opera" _[Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_(Stockhausen) "Sirius (Stockhausen)")_ (1975–77) for eight-channel electronic music with soprano, bass, trumpet, and bass clarinet, which has four different versions for the four seasons, each lasting over an hour and a half.

> In the 1950s and early 1960s, Stockhausen published a series of articles that established his importance in the area of music theory. Although these include analyses of music by [Mozart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"), [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [Bartók](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k "Béla Bartók"), [Stravinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky "Igor Stravinsky"), [Goeyvaerts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Goeyvaerts "Karel Goeyvaerts"), [Boulez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Boulez "Pierre Boulez"), [Nono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Nono_(composer) "Luigi Nono (composer)"), [Johannes Fritsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Fritsch), [Michael von Biel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_von_Biel "Michael von Biel"), and, especially, [Webern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Webern "Anton Webern"), the items on compositional theory directly related to his own work are regarded as the most important generally.

>Stockhausen was influential within pop and rock music as well. [Frank Zappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zappa "Frank Zappa") acknowledges Stockhausen in the liner notes of _[Freak Out!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_Out! "Freak Out!")_, his 1966 debut with [The Mothers of Invention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mothers_of_Invention "The Mothers of Invention"). On the back of [[The Who]]'s second LP released in the US, "[Happy Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Jack_(song) "Happy Jack (song)")", their primary composer and guitarist [Pete Townshend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Townshend "Pete Townshend"), is said to have "an interest in Stockhausen". [Rick Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_(musician) "Richard Wright (musician)") and [Roger Waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Waters "Roger Waters") of [Pink Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd "Pink Floyd") also acknowledge Stockhausen as an influence. San Francisco psychedelic groups [Jefferson Airplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Airplane "Jefferson Airplane") and the [Grateful Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead "Grateful Dead") are said to have done the same; Stockhausen said that the Grateful Dead were "well orientated toward new music". Founding members of Cologne-based experimental band [Can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band) "Can (band)"), [Irmin Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irmin_Schmidt "Irmin Schmidt") and [Holger Czukay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Czukay "Holger Czukay"), both studied with Stockhausen at the Cologne Courses for New Music. German electronic pioneers [Kraftwerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk "Kraftwerk") also say they studied with Stockhausen, and Icelandic vocalist [Björk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rk "Björk") has acknowledged Stockhausen's influence.
