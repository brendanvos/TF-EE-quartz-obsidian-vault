## Arcs
After several aborted attempts at a first chapter in the 1950s published in the magazine _[Manga Shōnen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga_Sh%C5%8Dnen "Manga Shōnen")_, Tezuka began _Dawn_ in 1967, serialized in _[COM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COM_(manga_magazine) "COM (manga magazine)")_. The serialization of _Phoenix_ would continue throughout his career, moving to _Manga Shōnen_ after _COM_'s closure in the mid-70s. The final volume, _Sun_, was serialized in _The Wild Age_.

#Dawn (黎明編, _reimei-hen_)

The first volume, originally serialized in 1967. This story took place in 240–70 AD, in the era of Queen [Himiko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himiko "Himiko") of the [Yamatai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamatai "Yamatai"). Using her army, led by feudal general [Sarutahiko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarutahiko_Okami "Sarutahiko Okami"), to invade the [Kumaso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumaso "Kumaso"), she seeks the Phoenix and eternal youth.

#Future (未来編, _mirai-hen_)

The second volume, originally serialized in 1967–68. In _Phoenix'_s [chronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology "Chronology"), this is the final story chronologically, taking place near the end of mankind. In 3404, the world has become super-modernized, but humanity has reached its peak and shows decline. A young man named Masato Yamanobe is living with his girlfriend, Tamami, a shapeshifting [alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life "Extraterrestrial life"). Pursued by Masato's boss, [Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(manga) "Rock (manga)"), they eventually take shelter at the isolated base of [mad scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_scientist "Mad scientist") Dr. Saruta, who attempts to preserve life on Earth with the assistance of his robot, [Robita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robita "Robita"). Eventually, nuclear war breaks out.

#Yamato (ヤマト編, _yamato-hen_) #Space

The third volume, originally serialized in 1968–69. This story took place in 320–50 ([Kofun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofun "Kofun") period), and is based on the _[Yamato-takeru-no-mikoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_Takeru "Yamato Takeru")_ legend. The decadent king of [Yamato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_Province "Yamato Province") is trying to have his own version of Japan's history written. Meanwhile, a "barbarian" tribe, the Kumaso, is writing an unbiased history. The king of Yamato sends his youngest son, Oguna, to murder the barbarian chief, Takeru. On his journey, Oguna encounters the Phoenix.

#Universe (宇宙編, _uchū-hen_)

The fourth volume, originally serialized in 1969; also known as _Space_. The story took place in 2577 AD, where four astronauts must escape their ruined spaceship in escape pods. The survivors eventually crash into a mysterious planet. Among them is Saruta, who contends with Makimura for the heart of their female companion, Nana. On this strange planet, they eventually meet the Phoenix.

#Hō-ō (鳳凰編, _[hō-ō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenghuang "Fenghuang")-hen_) #Karma

The fifth volume, originally serialized in 1969–1970. The story occurred in 720–752 AD (the period in which the [Daibutsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daibutsu "Daibutsu") of [Tōdai-ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Ddai-ji "Tōdai-ji") was built), during the [Nara period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara_period "Nara period"). One-eyed and one-armed young man Gao, an ancestor of Saruta, turns into a murderous bandit when he is rejected by his village. He attacks a sculptor, Akanemaru, and the two men's paths diverge, but their fates remain linked. Akanemaru becomes obsessed with the Phoenix to the point that he loses sight of his original dreams, while Gao eventually finds a state of grace despite his continuing hardships. _Hō-ō_ is widely considered the masterpiece of the _Phoenix_ series. [MSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi_no_Tori_Hououhen_(MSX) "Hi no Tori Hououhen (MSX)") and [Famicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi_no_Tori_Hououhen:_Gaou_no_Bouken "Hi no Tori Hououhen: Gaou no Bouken") video games, both developed by [Konami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami "Konami"), were based on this volume. The [Viz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viz_(comics) "Viz (comics)") (English) edition is entitled "_Karma_".

#Resurrection (復活編, _fukkatsu-hen_)

The sixth volume, originally serialized in 1970–1971. The story took place in 2482–3344 AD. In an age of robotics, technology and science, young Leon dies in a car accident. He is returned to life by scientific surgery, but his now mostly-artificial brain makes him see living things – including humans – as distorted clay figures, while he sees machines and robots as beauties. Leon falls in love with a worker robot, Chihiro, whom he sees as a beautiful girl, and would fight for this forbidden love. He would also find out the secret behind his accident. A side plot features the robot [Robita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robita "Robita"), who previously appeared in _Future_.

Robe of #Feathers (羽衣編, _hagoromo-hen_) #Civil_war

Serialized in _COM_, 1971. Published in English by Viz as an appendix to the second volume of _Civil War_ (_Turbulent Times_). Based on the story of the [Hagoromo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagoromo_(play) "Hagoromo (play)").

#Nostalgia (望郷編, _bōkyō-hen_)

Published in _COM_, 1971; continued in _Manga Shōnen_, 1976–1978. A science fiction epic about the rise and fall of civilization on the deceptively named desert planet of Eden and one boy's universe-spanning search for the planet of his ancestors: Earth. Features numerous cameos from other Science fiction-based Phoenix stories, including the shapeshifting alien "Moopies" first seen in _Future_, Makimura from _Universe_ and an early model of the Chihiro robot from _Resurrection_. [Black Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Jack_(character) "Black Jack (character)") also made an appearance here, under a different name.

#Turbulent Times (乱世編, _ranse-hen_) #Civil_war 

Published in _Manga Shōnen_, 1978–1980. The story is about a woodcutter named Benta and his childhood sweetheart, Obu, who are separated and caught up in the events of the [Genpei War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genpei_War "Genpei War"). Various historical figures, such as [Taira no Kiyomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taira_no_Kiyomori "Taira no Kiyomori"), appear as major and minor characters. Although the character of Gao (from _Ho-ō_) appears as a 400-year-old hermit and thus links _Ranse-hen_ to the rest of the series, this particular arc stands out for its much more naturalistic approach, with next to no fantasy elements in it (except for those used for comedic effect, such as telephones in the 12th century). The Viz (English) edition is entitled _Civil War_ and is split into two volumes, with _Robe of Feathers_ included as an appendix to the second volume.

#Life (生命編, _seimei-hen_)

Published in _Manga Shōnen_, 1980. A TV producer who attempts to procure human [clones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning "Cloning") to use in a _[The Most Dangerous Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Most_Dangerous_Game "The Most Dangerous Game")_-style [reality TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_TV "Reality TV") program learns the error of his ways when he is mistaken for a clone himself. This episode is notable for only featuring the Phoenix in flashbacks and also for introducing her half-human daughter who does not appear again after this episode.

#Strange_Beings (異形編, _igyō-hen_)

Published in _Manga Shōnen_, 1981. The story of a female Buddhist nun ([bhikkhuni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhikkhuni "Bhikkhuni")) who is imprisoned in a time-warp by the Phoenix as punishment for her sins along with her faithful retainer and is forced to become a healer treating the victims of wars from all over time and space including humans, [youkai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youkai "Youkai") and various extraterrestrials. This chapter was loosely based on the [Hyakki Yakō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyakki_Yak%C5%8D "Hyakki Yakō") [emakimono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emakimono "Emakimono") by the famous Japanese artist [Tosa Mitsunobu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosa_Mitsunobu "Tosa Mitsunobu") (although in the context of the story it's the complete opposite).

#Sun (太陽編, _taiyō-hen_) 

Published in _The Wild Age_, 1986–88. This is the longest story, and was the final volume completed before Tezuka's death. It centers on Harima, a young [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans "Koreans") soldier from the [Baekje Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baekje_Kingdom "Baekje Kingdom") whose head is replaced with that of a wolf by [Tang Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Dynasty "Tang Dynasty") soldiers following the defeat of the joint Baekje-Yamato force at the [Battle of Baekgang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Baekgang "Battle of Baekgang"). He then escapes to Japan where he becomes the feudal lord Inugami and becomes caught in the middle of the [Jinshin War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinshin_War "Jinshin War"), as well as joining a greater battle between supernatural forces and time-travelling to a bleak future world ruled by a theocracy that claimed to have captured the Phoenix. This chapter stands in stark contrast to the earlier historical Phoenix stories, which tended to de-mythologize the mythical characters therein, for instance in _Dawn_, many [Shinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto "Shinto") gods are portrayed as mere humans. In this chapter, however, a wide variety of mythical creatures are shown fighting against [Bodhisattva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva "Bodhisattva").


> The #Resurrection arc of _Phoenix_ inspired the lyrical theme of the 2018 song "[M.D.O.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwork_Immortality "Clockwork Immortality")" by heavy metal band [[Lovebites]]. In celebration of what would have been Tezuka's 90th birthday, Evil Line Records released the compilation album _New Gene, Inspired from Phoenix_ on October 30, 2019. It features songs inspired by _Phoenix_ written and performed by various artists, including [Glim Spanky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glim_Spanky "Glim Spanky"), [Kizuna AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kizuna_AI "Kizuna AI"), [Tavito Nanao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavito_Nanao "Tavito Nanao") and [Naotarō Moriyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naotar%C5%8D_Moriyama "Naotarō Moriyama")
