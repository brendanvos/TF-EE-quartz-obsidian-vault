 [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_mundi "Anima mundi")
 #Greek
> The _**anima mundi**_ ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek"): ψυχὴ κόσμου, _psychè kósmou_) or **world soul** is, according to several systems of thought, an intrinsic connection between all living beings, which relates to the world in much the same way as the [soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_(spirit) "Soul (spirit)") is connected to the human body.

> Although the concept of the _anima mundi_ originated in [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity"), similar ideas can be found in the thoughts of later European philosophers such as those of [Baruch Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza "Baruch Spinoza"), [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz"), [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant"), [Friedrich Schelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schelling "Friedrich Schelling"), and [Georg W.F. Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel "Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel") (particularly in his concept of _[Weltgeist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weltgeist "Weltgeist")_).


### Platonism
> Further information: [Neoplatonism § The world-soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism#The_world-soul "Neoplatonism"), and [Timaeus (dialogue)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(dialogue) "Timaeus (dialogue)")

> [[Plato]] adhered to this idea, identifying the universe as a living being:

> Thus, then, in accordance with the likely account, we must declare that this [Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos "Cosmos") has verily come into existence as a Living Creature endowed with soul and reason [...] a Living Creature, one and visible, containing within itself all the living creatures which are by nature akin to itself.

> — [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato"), _[Timaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(dialogue) "Timaeus (dialogue)")_ 30b–d, translated by W.R.M. Lamb

> Plato's _Timaeus_ describes this living cosmos as being built by the [demiurge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge "Demiurge") constructed as to be [self-identical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_identity "Law of identity") and [intelligible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligibility_(philosophy) "Intelligibility (philosophy)") to reason, according to a [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism "Rationalism") pattern expressed in [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical "Mathematical") principles and  [[Pythagorean interval|Pythagorean ratio]]s (describing the structure of the cosmos, and particularly the motions of the seven [[classical planets]])

#### Manichaeism
> In [Manichaeism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism "Manichaeism"), the _anima mundi_ was also called the Light Soul and the Living Soul ([Middle Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Persian_language "Middle Persian language"): grīw zīndag), contrasting it with matter, which was associated with lifelessness and death and within which the _anima mundi_ was imprisoned. The _anima mundi_ was personified as the [Suffering Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Manichaeism#Jesus_the_Suffering "Jesus in Manichaeism") (__Jesus patibilis__) who, like the [historical Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Manichaeism#Jesus_the_Messiah "Jesus in Manichaeism"), was depicted as being crucified ([[Crucifix]]) in the world. This _mystica cruxificio_ was present in all parts of the world, including the skies, soil, and trees, as expressed in the [Coptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language) [Manichaean psalms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaean_psalms "Manichaean psalms").

### [[Hermeticism]]
> The concept of the _anima mundi_ is present in the works of [hermetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism "Hermeticism") philosophers like [Paracelsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus "Paracelsus") and [Robert Fludd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fludd "Robert Fludd").
