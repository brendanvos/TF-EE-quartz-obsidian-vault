> **Carbon Based Lifeforms** is a Swedish [electronic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music "Electronic music") duo formed in [Gothenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothenburg "Gothenburg") in 1996 by Johannes Hedberg and Daniel Vadestrid (_[né](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A9 "Né")_ Ringström).

## History
### Formation and early period
> Hedberg and Ringström (both born in 1976) first met in 1991, and started collaborating on the [music tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker "Music tracker") sequencer software [[Protracker]] and later, the [[Amiga]] computer system. In 1994, they started to work on PCs and formed a music tracker trio with fellow Swedish musician and producer Mikael Lindqvist called Bassment Studios. In the following year, they moved once more to [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI "MIDI")-oriented music and formed Notch, focusing on [acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_house "Acid house"), [techno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno "Techno"), and [house music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music "House music"). Their first track was a remix of "What Would You Think" by [synthpop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthpop "Synthpop") group Mourning After. Lindqvist soon parted ways and Notch discontinued, but encouraged Hedberg and Ringström to continue recording their own music.

> The pair had started to fully explore ambient music after Hedberg's sister had picked up _Orgship_ (1994) by Solar Quest, which quickly became a favourite of theirs and influenced the two to make similar music. The electronic bands  [[The Future Sound of London]] and [Boards of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boards_of_Canada "Boards of Canada") were also a big influence on them; Segerstad called them "our role models". After initial tracks were put together still under their Notch moniker, the duo wished to explore the genre further by incorporating [drone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_music "Drone music") and [chill out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chill-out_music "Chill-out music") elements. This led to the formation of their own identity, Carbon Based Lifeforms, in 1996, initially as a side project from Notch. They named themselves after Notch's second demo album, and thought it fits "with our underlying themes of the combination of biology and technology, also it alludes to a lot of sci-fi concepts." The band had built an initial following as Notch, and a bigger one later as Carbon Based Lifeforms, on [MP3.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3.com "MP3.com") and [Last.fm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm "Last.fm"), which earned the group money following radio airplay exposure. When Last.fm switched from [Winamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp "Winamp") to another media player, the band saw a boost in traffic which also increased their income. Much of their music from their early period relied on delay and filter effects, and simpler sounds than their later tracks.
