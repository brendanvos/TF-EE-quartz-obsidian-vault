> **Chaos** ([Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): χάος, [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Ancient_Greek "Romanization of Ancient Greek"): _kháos_) is the mythological void state preceding the [creation of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_of_the_universe "Creation of the universe") (the cosmos) in #Greek [creation myths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth "Creation myth"). In [Christian theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_theology "Christian theology"), the same term is used to refer to the gap or the #abyss created by the [separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament "Firmament") of heaven and earth.

## Etymology
> Greek _kháos_ ([χάος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%87%CE%AC%CE%BF%CF%82 "wikt:χάος")) means '[emptiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emptiness "Emptiness"), vast void, [chasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasm "Chasm"), [abyss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyss_(religion) "Abyss (religion)")', related to the verbs _kháskō_ ([χάσκω](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%87%CE%AC%CF%83%CE%BA%CF%89 "wikt:χάσκω")) and _khaínō_ ([χαίνω](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%87%CE%B1%CE%AF%CE%BD%CF%89 "wikt:χαίνω")) 'gape, be wide open', from [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language "Proto-Indo-European language") _*ǵʰeh₂n-_, cognate to [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_language "Old English language") _geanian_, 'to gape', whence English _[yawn](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yawn "wikt:yawn")_.

> It may also mean space, the expanse of air, the nether abyss or infinite [darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkness "Darkness"). [Pherecydes of Syros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pherecydes_of_Syros "Pherecydes of Syros") (fl. 6th century BC) interprets _chaos_ as water, like something formless that can be differentiated.

## _Chaoskampf_
> The motif of _Chaoskampf_; lit. 'struggle against chaos') is ubiquitous in myth and legend, depicting a battle of a [culture hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_hero "Culture hero") deity with a _chaos monster_, often in the shape of a [serpent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_(symbolism) "Serpent (symbolism)") or [dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon "Dragon"). Parallel concepts appear in the Middle East and North Africa, such as the abstract conflict of ideas in the Egyptian duality of [Maat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maat "Maat") and [Isfet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfet_(Egyptian_mythology) "Isfet (Egyptian mythology)") or the battle of [Horus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus "Horus") and [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(deity) "Set (deity)").

## Greco-Roman tradition
> [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod") and the [Pre-Socratics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic "Pre-Socratic") use the Greek term in the context of [cosmogony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony "Cosmogony"). Hesiod's Chaos has been interpreted as either "the gaping void above the Earth created when Earth and Sky are separated from their primordial unity" or "the gaping space below the Earth on which Earth rests." Passages in Hesiod's _[Theogony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theogony "Theogony")_ suggest that Chaos was located below Earth but above [Tartarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus "Tartarus"). Primal Chaos was sometimes said to be the true foundation of reality, particularly by philosophers such as [Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus "Heraclitus").

### Archaic Period
> In [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod")'s _Theogony_, Chaos was the first thing to exist: "at first Chaos came to be" (or was), but next (possibly out of Chaos) came [Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(mythology) "Gaia (mythology)"), [Tartarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus "Tartarus"), and [Eros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros "Eros") (elsewhere the name [Eros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros "Eros") is used for a son of [Aphrodite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite "Aphrodite")). Unambiguously "born" from Chaos were [Erebus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erebus "Erebus") and [Nyx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyx "Nyx"). For Hesiod, Chaos, like Tartarus, though personified enough to have borne children, was also a place, far away, underground and "gloomy," beyond which lived the [[Titans]]. And, like the earth, the ocean, and the upper air, it was also capable of being affected by Zeus's thunderbolts.

> The notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of [immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#Ancient_Greek_religion "Immortality"). The main object of the first efforts to explain the world remained the description of its growth, from a beginning. They believed that the world arose out from a primal unity, and that this substance was the permanent base of all its being. [Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander "Anaximander") claims that the origin is [apeiron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeiron "Apeiron") (the unlimited), a divine and perpetual substance less definite than the common elements ([water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(classical_element) "Water (classical element)"), [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_(classical_element) "Air (classical element)"), [fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(classical_element) "Fire (classical element)"), and [earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(classical_element) "Earth (classical element)")) as they were understood to the early Greek philosophers. Everything is generated from _apeiron_, and must return there according to necessity. A conception of the nature of the world was that the earth below its surface stretches down indefinitely and has its roots on or above [Tartarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus "Tartarus"), the lower part of the underworld. In a phrase of [Xenophanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophanes "Xenophanes"), "The upper limit of the earth borders on air, near our feet. The lower limit reaches down to the "apeiron" (i.e. the unlimited)." The sources and limits of the earth, the sea, the sky, [Tartarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus "Tartarus"), and all things are located in a great windy-gap, which seems to be infinite, and is a later specification of "chaos".

### Classical Greece
>In [Aristophanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes "Aristophanes")'s comedy _[Birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birds_(play) "The Birds (play)")_, first there was Chaos, Night, Erebus, and Tartarus, from Night came Eros, and from Eros and Chaos came the race of birds.

> 	"At the beginning there was only Chaos, Night, dark Erebus, and deep Tartarus. Earth, the air and heaven had no existence. Firstly, blackwinged Night laid a germless [[egg]] in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebus, and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep Tartarus with dark Chaos, winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race, which was the first to see the light. That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros had brought together all the ingredients of the world, and from their marriage Heaven, Ocean, Earth, and the imperishable race of blessed gods sprang into being. Thus our origin is very much older than that of the dwellers in Olympus. We birds are the offspring of Eros; there are a thousand proofs to show it. We have wings and we lend assistance to lovers. How many handsome youths, who had sworn to remain insensible, have opened their thighs because of our power and have yielded themselves to their lovers when almost at the end of their youth, being led away by the gift of a quail, a waterfowl, a goose, or a cock.

> In [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato")’s Timaeus, the main work of Platonic cosmology, the concept of chaos finds its equivalent in the Greek expression _chôra_, which is interpreted, for instance, as shapeless space (_chôra_) in which material traces (_ichnê_) of the elements are in disordered motion (Timaeus 53a–b). However, the Platonic _chôra_ is not a variation of the [atomistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism") interpretation of the origin of the world, as is made clear by Plato's statement that the most appropriate definition of the chôra is "a receptacle of all becoming – its wetnurse, as it were" (Timaeus 49a), notabene a receptacle for the creative act of the demiurge, the world-maker.

> [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), in the context of his investigation of the concept of space in physics, "problematizes the interpretation of Hesiod’s chaos as 'void' or 'place without anything in it'. Aristotle understands chaos as something that exists independently of bodies and without which no perceptible bodies can exist. 'Chaos' is thus brought within the framework of an explicitly physical investigation. It has now outgrown the mythological understanding to a great extent and, in Aristotle’s work, serves above all to challenge the atomists who assert the existence of empty space."

### #Roman tradition

> For [[Publius Ovidius Naso|Ovid]], (43 BC – 17/18 AD), in his _[Metamorphoses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphoses "Metamorphoses")_, Chaos was an unformed mass, where all the elements were jumbled up together in a "shapeless heap".

> _Before the ocean and the earth appeared— before the skies had overspread them all—_
> _the face of Nature in a vast expanse was naught but Chaos uniformly waste._
> _It was a rude and undeveloped mass, that nothing made except a ponderous weight;_
> _and all discordant elements confused, were there congested in a shapeless heap._

> According to [Hyginus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyginus "Hyginus"): "From Mist (_[Caligo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achlys "Achlys")_) came Chaos. From Chaos and Mist, came Night (_Nox_), Day (_Dies_), Darkness (_Erebus_), and Ether (_Aether_)." An [Orphic tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphism_(religion) "Orphism (religion)") apparently had Chaos as the son of [Chronus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronus "Chronus") and [Ananke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ananke_(mythology) "Ananke (mythology)").

_Magnum Chaos_, wood-inlay by [Giovan Francesco Capoferri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovan_Francesco_Capoferri "Giovan Francesco Capoferri") at the [Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria_Maggiore,_Bergamo "Santa Maria Maggiore, Bergamo") in [Bergamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamo "Bergamo"), based on a design by [Lorenzo Lotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Lotto "Lorenzo Lotto").

> The Greco-Roman tradition of _prima materia_, notably including the 5th- and 6th-century [Orphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphism_(religion) "Orphism (religion)") cosmogony, was merged with biblical notions (_[Tehom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehom "Tehom")_) in [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") and inherited by [alchemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy") and [Renaissance magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_magic "Renaissance magic").

> The cosmic [[egg]] of Orphism was taken as the raw material for the alchemical [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|Magnum opus]] in early Greek alchemy. The first stage of the process of producing the [[Philosopher's stone]], i.e., [nigredo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigredo "Nigredo"), was identified with chaos. Because of association with the [Genesis creation narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative "Genesis creation narrative"), where "the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters" (Gen. 1:2), Chaos was further identified with the [classical element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element "Classical element") of [Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(classical_element) "Water (classical element)").

> [Ramon Llull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull "Ramon Llull") (1232–1315) wrote a _Liber Chaos_, in which he identifies Chaos as the primal form or matter created by God. Swiss alchemist [Paracelsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus "Paracelsus") (1493–1541) uses _chaos_ synonymously with "classical element" (because the primeval chaos is imagined as a formless congestion of all elements). Paracelsus thus identifies [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(classical_element) "Earth (classical element)") as "the chaos of the _gnomi_", i.e., the element of the [gnomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome "Gnome"), through which these spirits move unobstructed as fish do through water, or birds through air. An alchemical treatise by [Heinrich Khunrath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Khunrath "Heinrich Khunrath"), printed in Frankfurt in 1708, was entitled _Chaos_. The 1708 introduction states that the treatise was written in 1597 in Magdeburg, in the author's 23rd year of practicing alchemy. The treatise purports to quote Paracelsus on the point that "The light of the soul, by the will of the Triune God, made all earthly things appear from the primal Chaos." [Martin Ruland the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ruland_the_Younger "Martin Ruland the Younger"), in his 1612 _Lexicon Alchemiae_, states, "A crude mixture of matter or another name for _Materia Prima_ is _Chaos_, as it is in the Beginning."

> The term _[gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas")_ in [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") was coined by Dutch chemist [Jan Baptist van Helmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Baptist_van_Helmont "Jan Baptist van Helmont") in the 17th century directly based on the [Paracelsian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsianism "Paracelsianism") notion of chaos. The _g_ in _gas_ is due to the Dutch pronunciation of this letter as a [spirant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirant "Spirant"), also employed to pronounce Greek [χ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_(letter) "Chi (letter)").
