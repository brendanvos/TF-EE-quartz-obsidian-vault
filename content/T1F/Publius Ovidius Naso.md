> **Publius Ovidius Naso** ; 20 March 43 BC – 17/18 AD), known in English as **Ovid** ([/ˈɒvɪd/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [_OV-id_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")), was a [Roman poet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustan_literature_(ancient_Rome) "Augustan literature (ancient Rome)") who lived during the reign of [Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus "Augustus"). He was a younger contemporary of [Virgil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil "Virgil") and [Horace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace "Horace"), with whom he is often ranked as one of the three [canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_canon "Western canon") poets of [Latin literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_literature "Latin literature"). The [Imperial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") scholar [Quintilian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintilian "Quintilian") considered him the last of the #Latin #love  [elegists](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/elegist "wikt:elegist"). Although Ovid enjoyed enormous popularity during his lifetime, the emperor Augustus [exiled him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_of_Ovid "Exile of Ovid") to [Tomis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constan%C8%9Ba "Constanța"), the capital of the newly-organised province of [Moesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moesia "Moesia"), on the [Black Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea "Black Sea"), where he remained for the last nine or ten years of his life. Ovid himself attributed his banishment to a “poem and a mistake”, but his reluctance to disclose specifics has resulted in much speculation among scholars.

> Today, Ovid is most famous for the _[Metamorphoses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphoses "Metamorphoses")_, a continuous mythological narrative in fifteen books written in [dactylic hexameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactylic_hexameter "Dactylic hexameter"). He is also known for works in [elegiac couplets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegiac_couplet "Elegiac couplet") such as _[Ars Amatoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Amatoria "Ars Amatoria")_ ("The Art of #Love") and _[Fasti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasti_(poem) "Fasti (poem)")_. His poetry was much imitated during [Late Antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Antiquity "Late Antiquity") and the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"), and greatly influenced [Western art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_art "Western art") and [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_literature "Western literature"). The _Metamorphoses_ remains one of the most important sources of [classical mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mythology "Classical mythology") today.

> By 8 AD, Ovid had completed _[Metamorphoses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphoses "Metamorphoses")_, his most ambitious work, a hexameter [epic poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poem "Epic poem") in 15 books. Here he catalogued encyclopedically transformations in #Greek and #Roman mythology, from the emergence of the cosmos to the [apotheosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_cult_(ancient_Rome) "Imperial cult (ancient Rome)") of [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar "Julius Caesar"). The stories follow each other in the telling of human beings transformed to new bodies: trees, [[Stone|rock]]s , animals, #flower s, [constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation "Constellation"), etc. Simultaneously, he worked on the _[Fasti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasti_(poem) "Fasti (poem)")_, a six-book poem in elegiac couplets on the theme of the calendar of [Roman festivals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_festivals "Roman festivals") and astronomy. The composition of this poem was interrupted by Ovid's exile, and it is thought that Ovid abandoned work on the piece in Tomis. It is probably in this period that the double letters (16–21) in the _Heroides_ were composed, although there is some contention over their authorship. 

### _Amores_ ("The Loves")[

Main article: [Amores (Ovid)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amores_(Ovid) "Amores (Ovid)")

>The _Amores_ is a collection in three books of love poetry in elegiac meter, following the conventions of the elegiac genre developed by [Tibullus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibullus "Tibullus") and [Propertius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propertius "Propertius"). Elegy originates with Propertius and Tibullus, but Ovid is an innovator in the genre. Ovid changes the leader of his elegies from the poet, to Amor ( #Love or Cupid). This switch in focus from the triumphs of the poet, to the triumphs of love over people is the first of its kind for this genre of poetry. This Ovidian innovation can be summarized as the use of love as a metaphor for poetry. The books describe the many aspects of love and focus on the poet's relationship with a mistress called Corinna. Within the various poems, several describe events in the relationship, thus presenting the reader with some vignettes and a loose narrative.

>Main article: [Metamorphoses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphoses "Metamorphoses")

>The _Metamorphoses_, Ovid's most ambitious and well-known work, consists of a 15-book catalogue written in [dactylic hexameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactylic_hexameter "Dactylic hexameter") about transformations in Greek and Roman mythology set within a loose mytho-historical framework. The word "metamorphoses" is of Greek origin and means "transformations". Appropriately, the characters in this work undergo many different transformations. Within an extent of nearly 12,000 verses, almost 250 different myths are mentioned. Each myth is set outdoors where the mortals are often vulnerable to external influences. The poem stands in the tradition of mythological and etiological catalogue poetry such as [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod")'s _[Catalogue of Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Women "Catalogue of Women")_, [Callimachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callimachus "Callimachus")' _[Aetia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetia_(Callimachus) "Aetia (Callimachus)")_, [Nicander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicander "Nicander")'s _Heteroeumena_, and [Parthenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenius_of_Nicaea "Parthenius of Nicaea")' _Metamorphoses_.

The second book opens with [Phaethon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaethon#Ovid "Phaethon") and continues describing the love of Jupiter with [Callisto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callisto_(mythology) "Callisto (mythology)") and [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(mythology) "Europa (mythology)"). The third book focuses on the mythology of [Thebes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Thebes_(Boeotia) "Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)") with the stories of [Cadmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmus "Cadmus"), [Actaeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actaeon "Actaeon"), and [Pentheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentheus "Pentheus"). The fourth book focuses on three pairs of lovers: [Pyramus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramus "Pyramus") and [Thisbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thisbe "Thisbe"), [Salmacis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmacis "Salmacis") and [Hermaphroditus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphroditus "Hermaphroditus"), and [Perseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus "Perseus") and [Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(mythology) "Andromeda (mythology)").

The sixth book is a collection of stories about the rivalry between gods and mortals, beginning with [Arachne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachne "Arachne") and ending with [Philomela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philomela_(princess_of_Athens) "Philomela (princess of Athens)"). The seventh book focuses on [Medea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea "Medea"), as well as [Cephalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalus "Cephalus") and [Procris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procris "Procris"). The eighth book focuses on [Daedalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedalus "Daedalus")' flight, the [Calydonian boar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calydonian_boar "Calydonian boar") hunt, and the contrast between pious [Baucis and Philemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baucis_and_Philemon "Baucis and Philemon") and the wicked [Erysichthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erysichthon_of_Thessaly "Erysichthon of Thessaly").

The eleventh book compares the marriage of [Peleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peleus "Peleus") and [Thetis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thetis "Thetis") with the love of [Ceyx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceyx "Ceyx") and [Alcyone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcyone "Alcyone"). The twelfth book moves from myth to history describing the exploits of [Achilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles "Achilles"), the [battle of the centaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapith#Centauromachy "Lapith") ( #centaur ), and [Iphigeneia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigeneia "Iphigeneia"). The thirteenth book discusses the [contest over Achilles' arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles#Fate_of_Achilles'_armour "Achilles"), and [Polyphemus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus"). The fourteenth moves to Italy, describing the journey of [Aeneas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneas "Aeneas"), [Pomona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomona_(mythology) "Pomona (mythology)") and [Vertumnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertumnus "Vertumnus"), and [Romulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus "Romulus") and [Hersilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hersilia "Hersilia"). The final book opens with a philosophical lecture by [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras "Pythagoras") and the deification of [Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar "Julius Caesar"). The end of the poem praises [Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus "Augustus") and expresses Ovid's belief that his poem has earned him immortality.

>In analyzing the _Metamorphoses_, scholars have focused on Ovid's organization of his vast body of material. The ways that stories are linked by geography, themes, or contrasts creates interesting effects and constantly forces the reader to evaluate the connections. Ovid also varies his tone and material from different literary genres; [G. B. Conte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian_Biagio_Conte "Gian Biagio Conte") has called the poem "a sort of gallery of these various literary genres". In this spirit, Ovid engages creatively with his predecessors, alluding to the full spectrum of classical poetry. Ovid's use of Alexandrian epic, or elegiac couplets, shows his fusion of erotic and psychological style with traditional forms of epic.

> A concept drawn from the Metamorphoses is the idea of the white lie or [pious fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pious_fraud "Pious fraud"): "pia mendacia fraude".
