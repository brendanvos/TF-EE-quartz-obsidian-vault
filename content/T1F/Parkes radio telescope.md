### Receivers
> The focus cabin is located at the focus of the parabolic dish, supported by three struts 27 metres (89 ft) above the dish. The cabin contains multiple [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio "Radio") and [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave") detectors, which can be switched into the focus beam for different science observations.
> These include:
- 1,050-centimetre (34.4 ft) receiver _(Replaced now by UWL)_
- The Multibeam Receiver – a 13-horned receiver cooled at −200 °C (−328.0 °F; 73.1 K) for the 21-centimetre (8.3 in) Hydrogen line.
- H-OH receiver _(Replaced now by UWL)_ (Tenuous #Hō-ō connection?)
- GALILEO receiver _(Replaced now by UWL)_ #Galileo
- AT multiband receivers, covering 2.2-2.5,4.5-5.1 and 8.1-8.7 GHz
- METH6, covering 5.9-6.8 GHz
- MARS ( #X band receiver), covering 8.1-8.5 GHz ([[Mars (planet)|Mars]])
- KU-BAND, covering 12–15 GHz
- 13MM (K band receiver), covering 16–26 GHz
- #Ultra Wideband Low (UWL) receiver – installed in 2018 it can simultaneously receive signals from 700 MHz to 4 GHz. It is cooled to −255 °C (−427.0 °F; 18.1 K) to minimise noise and will enable astronomers to work on more than one project at once.

### 18m "Kennedy Dish" antenna

The 18-metre (59 ft) "Kennedy Dish" antenna was transferred from the [Fleurs Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fleurs_Observatory&action=edit&redlink=1 "Fleurs Observatory (page does not exist)") (where it was part of the [Chris Cross Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills_Cross_Telescope "Mills Cross Telescope")) in 1963. Mounted on rails and powered by a tractor engine to allow the distance between the antenna and the main dish to be easily varied, it was used as an [interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometer "Interferometer") with the main dish. Phase instability due to an exposed cable meant that its pointing ability was diminished, but it was able to be used for identifying size and brightness distributions. In 1968 it successfully proved that [Radio galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_galaxy "Radio galaxy") lobes were not expanding, and in the same era contributed to [Hydrogen line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_line "Hydrogen line") and [OH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl_radical#Astronomical_importance "Hydroxyl radical") investigations. As a stand-alone antenna it was used in studying the [[Magellanic Stream]].

It was used as an uplink antenna in the Apollo program, as the larger Parkes telescope is receive-only. It is preserved by the Australia Telescope National Facility.

## Astronomy research
### Timeline
> 1960s
> - Built in 1961 and was fully operational by 1963.
>- A 1962 series of [[The Moon|Lunar]] [[Occultation]]s of the radio source [3C 273](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3C_273 "3C 273") observed by the Parkes Telescope were used to locate its exact position, allowing astronomers to find and study its visual component. Soon to be called "quasi-stellar radio sources" ([quasar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar "Quasar")), Parkes observation was the first time this type of object to be associated with an optical counterpart.
>- 1964 to 1966, all-sky survey at 408 MHz of the southern sky is conducted and published (first version of the _Parkes Catalogue of Radio Sources_) finding over 2000 radio sources including many new quasars.
>- Second all-sky survey at 2,700 MHz begins in 1968 (completed in 1980).
	
> 1990s
> - June and November 1990, Parkes collaborates with the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") and the [National Radio Astronomy Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Radio_Astronomy_Observatory "National Radio Astronomy Observatory") to conduct a 5GHZ (6 cm) all-sky survey (The Parkes-MIT-NRAO (PMN) Surveys). The Telescope is equipped with a NRAO multi-beam receiver operating at a frequency of 4850 MHz.
> - Between 1997 and 2002 it conducted the [H I Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIPASS "HIPASS") ( #pass-filter ) hydrogen survey, the largest blind survey for galaxies in the [hydrogen line (21-centimeter line or H I line)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_line "Hydrogen line") to date.

### Fast radio burst
> [Fast radio bursts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst "Fast radio burst") were discovered in 2007 when [Duncan Lorimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Lorimer "Duncan Lorimer") of [West Virginia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_University "West Virginia University") assigned his student David Narkevic to look through archival data recorded in 2001 by the Parkes radio dish. Analysis of the survey data found a 30-[jansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jansky "Jansky") [dispersed burst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)#Dispersion_in_pulsar_timing "Dispersion (optics)") ([[Optical Dispersion]]) which occurred on 24 July 2001, less than 5 milliseconds in duration, located 3° from the [Small Magellanic Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Magellanic_Cloud "Small Magellanic Cloud"). At the time it was theorised FRBs might be signals from another galaxy, emissions from neutron stars or black holes. More recent results confirm that [magnetars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetar "Magnetar"), a kind of highly magnetised neutron star, may be one source of fast radio bursts.'

### Breakthrough Listen
> The telescope has been contracted to be used in a search for radio signals from extraterrestrial technologies for the heavily funded project [[Breakthrough Listen]]. The principal role of the Parkes Telescope in the program will be to conduct a survey of the Milky Way galactic plane over 1.2 to 1.5 GHz and a targeted search of approximately 1000 nearby stars over the frequency range 0.7 to 4 GHz.
