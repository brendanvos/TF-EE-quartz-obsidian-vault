The Hermetic Order of the [[Gold]]en #Dawn ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _Ordo Hermeticus Aurorae Aureae_), more commonly the **Golden Dawn** (_Aurora Aurea_), was a [secret society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_society#Europe "Secret society") devoted to the study and practice of #occult [[Hermeticism]] and [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Known as a [magical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_organization "Magical organization"), the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was active in [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain "Great Britain") and focused its practices on [theurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theurgy "Theurgy") and spiritual development. Many present-day concepts of ritual and [magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(paranormal) "Magic (paranormal)") that are at the centre of contemporary traditions, such as [Wicca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca "Wicca") and [Thelema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema "Thelema"), were inspired by the Golden Dawn, which became one of the largest single influences on 20th-century Western [occultism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultism "Occultism").

> The foundational documents of the original Order of the Golden Dawn, known as the [Cipher Manuscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_Manuscripts "Cipher Manuscripts"), are written in English using the [Trithemius cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trithemius_cipher "Trithemius cipher"). The manuscripts give the specific outlines of the Grade Rituals of the Order and prescribe a curriculum of graduated teachings that encompass the [[Hermetic Qabalah]], [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology "Astrology"), [occult tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinatory,_esoteric_and_occult_tarot "Divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot"), [geomancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomancy "Geomancy"), and [alchemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy").

> According to the records of the Order, the manuscripts passed from [Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_R._H._Mackenzie "Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie"), a Masonic scholar, to the Rev. [A. F. A. Woodford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._F._A._Woodford "A. F. A. Woodford"), whom British occult writer [Francis King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_X._King "Francis X. King") describes as the fourth founder (although Woodford died shortly after the Order was founded). The documents did not excite Woodford, and in February 1886 he passed them on to Freemason [William Wynn Westcott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wynn_Westcott "William Wynn Westcott"), who managed to decode them in 1887. Westcott, pleased with his discovery, called on fellow Freemason [Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Liddell_MacGregor_Mathers "Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers") for a second opinion. Westcott asked for Mathers' help to turn the manuscripts into a coherent system for lodge work. Mathers, in turn, asked fellow Freemason [William Robert Woodman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Robert_Woodman "William Robert Woodman") to assist the two, and he accepted. Mathers and Westcott have been credited with developing the ritual outlines in the Cipher Manuscripts into a workable format. Mathers, however, is generally credited with the design of the curriculum and rituals of the Second Order, which he called the _Rosae Rubae et Aureae Crucis_ ("Ruby [[Roses|Rose]] and [[Gold]]en [[Cross]]" or the _RR et AC_).
