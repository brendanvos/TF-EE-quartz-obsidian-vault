> **Apollo 11** (July 16–24, 1969) was the American [spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight") that first [landed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing "Moon landing") humans on [[The Moon]]. Commander [Neil Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong "Neil Armstrong") and lunar module pilot [Buzz Aldrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin "Buzz Aldrin") landed the [Apollo Lunar Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module "Apollo Lunar Module") [_Eagle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Module_Eagle "Lunar Module Eagle") on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Coordinated Universal Time"), and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named [Tranquility Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranquility_Base "Tranquility Base") upon landing. Armstrong and Aldrin collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot [Michael Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut) "Michael Collins (astronaut)") flew the [Command Module _Columbia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Module_Columbia "Command Module Columbia") in [lunar orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit "Lunar orbit"), and were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin _Columbia_.

> Apollo 11 was launched by a [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V "Saturn V") ([[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]) rocket from [Kennedy Space Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center "Kennedy Space Center") on [Merritt Island, Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merritt_Island,_Florida "Merritt Island, Florida"), on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")'s [Apollo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program"). The Apollo [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_(spacecraft) "Apollo (spacecraft)") had three parts: a [command module (CM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module#Command_module_(CM) "Apollo command and service module") with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a [service module (SM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_service_module "Apollo service module"), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a [lunar module (LM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module "Apollo Lunar Module") that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.

> After being [sent to the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-lunar_injection "Trans-lunar injection") by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into [_Eagle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Module_Eagle "Lunar Module Eagle") and landed in the [Sea of Tranquility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Tranquility "Sea of Tranquility") on July 20. The astronauts used _Eagle_'s ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned _Eagle_ before they performed the maneuvers that propelled _Columbia_ out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and [splashed down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown "Splashdown") in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.

>Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on [live TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_television "Live television") to a worldwide audience. He described the event as "one small step for \[a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Apollo 11 effectively proved U.S. victory in the [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race "Space Race") to demonstrate spaceflight superiority, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States") [John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy "John F. Kennedy"), "before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."

## Personnel
### Prime crew
> The initial crew assignment of Commander [Neil Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong "Neil Armstrong"), Command Module Pilot (CMP) [Jim Lovell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lovell "Jim Lovell")( #love) , and Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) [Buzz Aldrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin "Buzz Aldrin") on the backup crew for Apollo 9 was officially announced on November 20, 1967. Lovell and Aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of [Gemini 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_12 "Gemini 12")( #Num12 ). Due to design and manufacturing delays in the LM, Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.

### Capsule communicators
> The [capsule communicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_communicator "Capsule communicator") (CAPCOM) was an astronaut at the [Mission Control Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center "Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center") in [Houston, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston,_Texas "Houston, Texas"), who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew. For Apollo 11, the CAPCOMs were: [Charles Duke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Duke "Charles Duke"), Ronald Evans, [Bruce McCandless II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_McCandless_II "Bruce McCandless II"), James Lovell, William Anders, Ken Mattingly, Fred Haise, [Don L. Lind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_L._Lind "Don L. Lind"), [Owen K. Garriott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_K._Garriott "Owen K. Garriott") and [Harrison Schmitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Schmitt "Harrison Schmitt")

### Other key personnel

|Jamye Flowers ( #flower )|Secretary for astronauts|
|[Gene Shoemaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Shoemaker "Gene Shoemaker") ( #Shoemaker )|Geologist who trained astronauts in field geology|

### Mementos
> Neil Armstrong's LM PPK contained a piece of wood from the [Wright brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers "Wright brothers")' 1903 _[Wright Flyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer "Wright Flyer")_'s left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing, along with a [[Diamond]]-studded [astronaut pin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut_pin "Astronaut pin") originally given to Slayton by the widows of the Apollo 1 crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on that mission and given to Slayton afterwards, but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton. Armstrong took it with him on Apollo 11.

### Landing
> He then took [communion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist "Eucharist") privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist [Madalyn Murray O'Hair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madalyn_Murray_O%27Hair "Madalyn Murray O'Hair") (who had objected to the [Apollo 8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8_Genesis_reading "Apollo 8 Genesis reading")) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. For this reason, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the [Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster,_Texas "Webster, Texas") [Presbyterian Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterianism "Presbyterianism"), and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, Dean Woodruff. Webster Presbyterian possesses the #chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20. The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, but they chose to begin preparations for the EVA early, thinking they would be unable to sleep.

### Lunar surface operations
> Apollo 11 used [[slow-scan television]] (TV) incompatible with broadcast TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor (thus, a broadcast of a broadcast), significantly reducing the quality of the picture. The signal was received at [Goldstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldstone_Deep_Space_Communications_Complex "Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex") in the United States, but with better fidelity by [Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeysuckle_Creek_Tracking_Station "Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station") near [Canberra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra "Canberra") in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive [[Parkes radio telescope]] in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, but [recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11_missing_tapes "Apollo 11 missing tapes") were likely destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.
