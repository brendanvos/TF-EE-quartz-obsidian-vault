> **Hermetic Qabalah** (from [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language") קַבָּלָה _(qabalah)_ 'reception, accounting') is a [Western esoteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_esotericism "Western esotericism") tradition involving [mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism "Mysticism") and the #occult. It is the underlying philosophy and framework for magical societies such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]], [Thelemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelemic "Thelemic") orders, mystical-religious societies such as the [Builders of the Adytum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builders_of_the_Adytum "Builders of the Adytum") and the [Fellowship of the Rosy Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellowship_of_the_Rosy_Cross "Fellowship of the Rosy Cross")([[Roses|Rose]], [[Cross]])_, and is a precursor to the [Neopagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopaganism "Neopaganism"), [Wiccan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca "Wicca") and [New Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age "New Age") movements. The Hermetic Qabalah is the basis for [Qliphothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qliphoth "Qliphoth") Qabala as studied by [left-hand path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-hand_path "Left-hand path") orders, such as the [Typhonian Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhonian_Order "Typhonian Order").

>Hermetic Qabalah arose alongside and united with the [Christian Cabalistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Kabbalah "Christian Kabbalah") involvement in the European [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance"), becoming variously [Esoteric Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_Christianity "Esoteric Christianity"), non-Christian, or anti-Christian across its different schools in the modern era. It draws on a great many influences, most notably: [Jewish Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah "Kabbalah"), [Western astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_astrology "Western astrology"), [[Alchemy]], [Pagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism "Paganism") religions, especially [[Egypt]]ian and Greco-Roman ( #Greek and #Roman ) (it is from the latter that the term "Hermetic" is derived), [neoplatonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism "Neoplatonism"), [gnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism "Gnosticism"), the Enochian system of angelic magic of [John Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee_(mathematician) "John Dee (mathematician)") and [Edward Kelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kelley "Edward Kelley"), [hermeticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism "Hermeticism"), [tantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantra "Tantra") and the symbolism of the tarot. Hermetic Qabalah differs from the Jewish form in being a more admittedly [syncretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism "Syncretism") system; however, it shares many concepts with Jewish Kabbalah.

### Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn
>Hermetic Qabalah was developed extensively by the [Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn "Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn"), Within the Golden Dawn, the fusing of Qabalistic principles such as the ten Sephiroth with Greek and Egyptian deities was made more cohesive and was extended to encompass other systems such as the Enochian system of angelic magic of [John Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee_(mathematician) "John Dee (mathematician)") and certain Eastern (particularly Hindu and Buddhist) concepts, all within the structure of a [Masonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry "Freemasonry") or [Rosicrucian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucian "Rosicrucian") style esoteric order.

>Aleister Crowley, who passed through the Golden Dawn before going on to form his own magical orders, is the most widely known exponent of Hermetic Magic or [Magick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_(Aleister_Crowley) "Magick (Aleister Crowley)") as he preferred to spell it. Crowley's book _[Liber 777](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber_777 "Liber 777")_ ( #Num777) is a good illustration of the wider Hermetic approach. It is a set of tables of correspondences relating various parts of ceremonial magic and Eastern and Western religion to the thirty-two numbers representing the ten spheres (Sephiroth) plus the twenty-two paths of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. The [panentheistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panentheism "Panentheism") nature of Hermetic Qabalists is plainly evident here, as one may simply check the table to see that [Chesed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesed_(Kabbalah) "Chesed (Kabbalah)") (חסד "Mercy") corresponds to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [Isis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis "Isis"), the colour #blue (on the Queen Scale), [Poseidon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poseidon "Poseidon"), [Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma_(god) "Brahma (god)"), and [amethyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amethyst "Amethyst").

### The Sephiroth in Hermetic Qabalah
> ...
> Each sephirah is a nexus of divine energy, and each has a number of attributions. These attributions enable the Qabalist to form a comprehension of each particular sephirah's characteristics. This manner of applying many attributions to each sephirah is an exemplar of the diverse nature of Hermetic Qabalah. For example, the sephirah Hod has the attributions of: Glory, perfect intelligence, the eights of the tarot deck, the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the [[Egypt]]ian god Thoth, the archangel Michael, the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and the alchemical element [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]. The general principle involved is that the Qabalist will meditate on all these attributions and by this means to acquire an understanding of the character of the sephirah including all its correspondences.
