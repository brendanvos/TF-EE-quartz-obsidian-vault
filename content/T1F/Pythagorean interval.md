> In [musical tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tuning "Musical tuning") theory, a **Pythagorean interval** is a [musical interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_interval "Musical interval") with [frequency ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_ratio "Interval ratio") equal to a [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation "Exponentiation") of two divided by a power of three, or [vice versa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_versa "Vice versa"). For instance, the [perfect fifth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth "Perfect fifth") with ratio 3/2 (equivalent to 3/ 2) and the [perfect fourth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fourth "Perfect fourth") with ratio 4/3 #3/4 (equivalent to 2/ 3) are Pythagorean intervals. 

> All the intervals between the notes of a scale are Pythagorean if they are tuned using the [Pythagorean tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning "Pythagorean tuning") system. However, some Pythagorean intervals are also used in other tuning systems. For instance, the above-mentioned Pythagorean perfect fifth and fourth are also used in [just intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation "Just intonation").
