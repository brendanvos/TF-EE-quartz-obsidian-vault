Breaking this string up into substrings of length 2 leaves numbers which are all divisible by three: 
> 42 45 36 27 57 48 15 45 36 63 09 15 48 57

Dividing them by three leaves numbers which can be converted to letters (using A1Z26):
> 14 15 12 09 19 16 5 15 12 21 03 05 16 19

This results in the following string:
> nolispeoluceps

When mirrored this gives the Latin: 
> speculo epsilon

Speculo means "mirror" in Latin. 
Mirroring the character epsilon "Îµ" gives the number "3".
