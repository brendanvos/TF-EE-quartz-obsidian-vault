An **egg** is an organic vessel grown by an animal to carry a possibly [fertilized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilization "Fertilization") [egg cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_cell "Egg cell") (a [zygote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygote "Zygote")) and to [incubate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_incubation "Egg incubation")([[Incubator]]) from it an [embryo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo "Embryo") within the egg until the embryo has become an animal [fetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus "Fetus") that can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches.

Most [arthropods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod "Arthropod"), [vertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrates "Vertebrates") (excluding [live-bearing mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live-bearing_mammal "Live-bearing mammal")), and [mollusks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusca "Mollusca") lay eggs, although some, such as [scorpions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion "Scorpion"), do not.

[Reptile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile "Reptile") eggs, [bird eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg "Bird egg"), and [monotreme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotreme "Monotreme") eggs are laid out of water and are surrounded by a protective [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggshell "Eggshell"), either flexible or inflexible. Eggs laid on land or in nests are usually kept within a warm and favorable temperature range while the embryo grows. When the embryo is adequately developed it hatches, i.e., breaks out of the egg's shell. Some embryos have a temporary [egg tooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_tooth "Egg tooth") they use to crack, pip, or break the eggshell or covering.
