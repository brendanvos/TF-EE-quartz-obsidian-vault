> Alongside his solo work, Eno collaborated frequently with other musicians in the 1970s, including [Robert Fripp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp "Robert Fripp"), [Harmonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonia_(band) "Harmonia (band)"), [Cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_(band) "Cluster (band)"), [Harold Budd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Budd "Harold Budd"), [[David Bowie]], [David Byrne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Byrne "David Byrne") and [Judy Nylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Nylon "Judy Nylon"). He also established himself as a sought-after [producer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_producer "Music producer"), working on albums by [John Cale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cale "John Cale"), [Jon Hassell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hassell "Jon Hassell"), [Laraaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laraaji "Laraaji"), [Talking Heads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads "Talking Heads"), [Ultravox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultravox "Ultravox") #Ultra , and [Devo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devo "Devo"), as well as the [no wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_wave "No wave") compilation _[No New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_New_York "No New York")_ (1978). In subsequent decades, Eno continued to record solo albums and produce for other artists, most prominently [U2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2 "U2") and [Coldplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldplay "Coldplay"), alongside work with artists such as [Daniel Lanois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Lanois "Daniel Lanois"), [Laurie Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Anderson "Laurie Anderson"), [Grace Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Jones "Grace Jones"), [Slowdive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowdive "Slowdive"), [Karl Hyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Hyde "Karl Hyde"), [James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_(band) "James (band)"), [Kevin Shields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Shields "Kevin Shields"), and [Damon Albarn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Albarn "Damon Albarn").

> Dating back to his time as a student, Eno has also worked in other media, including [sound installations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_installations "Sound installations"), film, and writing. In the mid-1970s, he co-developed [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies "Oblique Strategies"), a deck of cards featuring aphorisms intended to spur [creative thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity "Creativity"). From the 1970s onwards, Eno's installations have included the sails of the [Sydney Opera House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Opera_House "Sydney Opera House") in 2009 and the [[Lovell Telescope]]  at [Jodrell Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodrell_Bank "Jodrell Bank") in 2016. An advocate of a range of humanitarian causes, Eno writes on a variety of subjects and is a founding member of the [Long Now Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Now_Foundation "Long Now Foundation").

> In 1966, Eno studied for a diploma in Fine Arts at the [Winchester School of Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_School_of_Art "Winchester School of Art"), from which he graduated in 1969. At Winchester Eno once attended a lecture by future [[The Who]] guitarist [Pete Townshend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Townshend "Pete Townshend"), also a former student of Ascott's; he cites this as the moment when he realised he could make music without formal training.

> Before Eno made _[On Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Land "On Land"),_ [Robert Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Quine "Robert Quine") played him [Miles Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis "Miles Davis")' "[He Loved Him Madly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Up_With_It "Get Up With It")" (1974). Eno stated in the liner notes for _On Land,_ "Teo Macero's revolutionary production on that piece seemed to me to have the 'spacious' quality I was after, and like Federico Fellini's 1973 film _Amarcord_, it too became a touchstone to which I returned frequently."

> In 1983, Eno collaborated with his brother, [Roger Eno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Eno "Roger Eno"), and [Daniel Lanois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Lanois "Daniel Lanois") on the album _[Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo:_Atmospheres_and_Soundtracks "Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks")_ that had been commissioned by Al Reinert for his film _[For All Mankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_All_Mankind_(film) "For All Mankind (film)")_ (1989). Tracks from the album were subsequently used in several other films, including _[Trainspotting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainspotting_(film) "Trainspotting (film)")_. #Apollo 

>  In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated that it would take almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. Eno achieves this through the blending of several independent musical tracks of varying length. Each track features different musical elements and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again re-configuring differently with the other tracks. He has presented this music in his own art and sound installations and those in collaboration with other artists, including _[I Dormienti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Dormienti "I Dormienti") (The Sleepers)_, _[Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightness:_Music_for_the_Marble_Palace_%E2%80%93_The_State_Russian_Museum,_St._Petersburg "Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace – The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg")_ ([[Marble]]), and _[Music for Civic Recovery Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_for_Civic_Recovery_Centre "Music for Civic Recovery Centre")_.

> In late 2006, Eno released _[77 Million Paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/77_Million_Paintings "77 Million Paintings")_, a program of generative video and music specifically for home computers. As its title suggests, there is a possible combination of 77 million paintings where the viewer will see different combinations of video slides prepared by Eno each time the program is launched. Likewise, the accompanying music is generated by the program so that it's almost certain the listener will never hear the same arrangement twice. The second edition of "77 Million Paintings" featuring improved morphing and a further two layers of sound was released on 14 January 2008. In June 2007, when commissioned in the [Yerba Buena Center for the Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_Buena_Center_for_the_Arts "Yerba Buena Center for the Arts"), San Francisco, California, [Annabeth Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabeth_Robinson "Annabeth Robinson") (AngryBeth Shortbread) recreated _77 Million Paintings_ in [Second Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life "Second Life"). #Num7 

> Asteroid [81948 Eno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/81948_Eno "81948 Eno"), discovered by [Marc Buie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Buie "Marc Buie") at [Cerro Tololo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Tololo_Inter-American_Observatory "Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory") in 2000, was named in his honor. The official [naming citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meanings_of_minor_planet_names:_81001%E2%80%9382000#948 "Meanings of minor planet names: 81001–82000") was published by the [Minor Planet Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Planet_Center "Minor Planet Center") on 18 May 2019

### Obscure Records

> Eno started the [Obscure Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscure_Records "Obscure Records") label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The first group of three releases included his own composition, _[Discreet Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discreet_Music "Discreet Music")_, and the now-famous _[The Sinking of the Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sinking_of_the_Titanic_(Bryars) "The Sinking of the Titanic (Bryars)")_ #Titanic(1969) and _[Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus%27_Blood_Never_Failed_Me_Yet "Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet")_ (1971) by [Gavin Bryars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Bryars "Gavin Bryars"). The second side of _Discreet Music_ consisted of several versions of German [baroque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_music "Baroque music") composer [Johann Pachelbel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Pachelbel "Johann Pachelbel")'s _[Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_in_D "Canon in D")_, the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage and to which he applied various algorithmic transformations, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a [tape loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_loop "Tape loop") system for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds in some of his collaborations with Robert Fripp, most notably on _[Evening Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening_Star_(Fripp_%26_Eno_album) "Evening Star (Fripp & Eno album)")_. Ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by [John Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_(composer) "John Adams (composer)"), [Michael Nyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Nyman "Michael Nyman"), and [John Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage "John Cage").

> His groundbreaking work in [electronic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music "Electronic music") has been said to have brought widespread attention to and innovations in the role of electronic technology in recording. [[Pink Floyd]] keyboardist [Rick Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_(musician) "Richard Wright (musician)") said he "often eulogised" Eno's abilities.
