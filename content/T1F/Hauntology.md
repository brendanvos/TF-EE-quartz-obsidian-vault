> **Hauntology** is a [music genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre "Music genre") or a loosely defined stylistic feature that evokes [cultural memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_memory "Cultural memory") and aesthetics of the past. It developed in the 2000s primarily among British [electronic musicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music "Electronic music"), and typically draws on British cultural sources from the 1940s to the 1970s, including [library music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_music "Library music"), film and TV [soundtracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack "Soundtrack"), [psychedelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_music "Psychedelic music"), and [public information films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_information_films "Public information films"), often through the use of [sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(music) "Sample (music)").

> The term was derived from philosopher [Jacques Derrida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida "Jacques Derrida")'s [concept of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauntology "Hauntology"). In the mid-2000s, it was adapted by theorists [Simon Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Reynolds "Simon Reynolds") and [Mark Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fisher "Mark Fisher"). Hauntology is associated with the UK record label [[Ghost Box Records]], in addition to artists such as [the Caretaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Caretaker_(musician) "The Caretaker (musician)"), [Burial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial_(musician) "Burial (musician)"), and [Philip Jeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Jeck "Philip Jeck"). Music genres [hypnagogic pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogic_pop "Hypnagogic pop") and [chillwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chillwave "Chillwave") descended from hauntology.


## Characteristics

> In music, hauntology is predominantly associated with a British [electronic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music "Electronic music") trend but it can apply to any art concerned with the aesthetics of the past. The trend is often tied to notions of [retrofuturism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrofuturism "Retrofuturism"), whereby artists evoke the past by utilising the "spectral sounds of old music technology". The trend involves the [sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(music) "Sample (music)") of older sound sources to evoke deep [cultural memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_memory "Cultural memory"). Critic [Simon Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Reynolds "Simon Reynolds") stated in a 2006 article that "this strand of 'ghostified' music doesn’t quite constitute a genre, a scene, or even a network. [...] more of a flavour or atmosphere than a style with boundaries", although in a 2017 article he summarized it as a "largely British genre of eerie electronics fixated on ideas of decaying memory and lost futures". A 2009 [blog post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_post "Blog post") by academic Adam Harper stated that "\[h\]auntology is not a genre of art or music, but an aesthetic effect, a way of reading and appreciating art".

> Hauntological music draws on varied [postwar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postwar "Postwar") cultural sources from the 1940s through the 1970s which lie outside the usual canon of popular music, including [library music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_music "Library music"), film and television [soundtracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack "Soundtrack"), [educational music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_music "Educational music"), and the sonic experimentation of the [BBC Radiophonic Workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop "BBC Radiophonic Workshop"), as well as electronic and [folk music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music "Folk music") sources. Other British influences include obscure [[musique concrète]] composers and [Joe Meek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Meek "Joe Meek")'s album _[I Hear a New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Hear_a_New_World "I Hear a New World")_, as well as [psychedelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_music "Psychedelic music") and [public information films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_information_film "Public information film"). Also important is the appropriation of visual iconography from this earlier period, including graphic design elements of [school textbooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textbook "Textbook"), [public information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_information "Public information") posters, and [television idents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_ident "Television ident").

>Artists typically use vintage recording devices such as cassettes and [synthesisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesiser "Synthesiser") from the 1960s and 1970s. Production often foregrounds the [grain of the recording](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_artifact "Sonic artifact"), including vinyl noise and [tape hiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_hiss "Tape hiss") derived from the degraded musical or [spoken word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_word "Spoken word") samples commonly used. Sampling is used to "evoke 'dead presences'" which are transformed into "eerie sonic markers". Artists often mix antique synthesiser tones, acoustic instruments, and digital techniques, as well as [found sounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Found_sound "Found sound"), abstract noise, and industrial [drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_(music) "Drone (music)").

## Critical analysis

> Hauntological music is identified with British culture, and was described as an attempt to evoke "a #nostalgia for a #future that never came to pass, with a vision of a strange, alternate Britain, constituted from the reordered refuse of the [postwar period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postwar_period "Postwar period")" by _The Oxford Handbook of Music and Virtuality_. Simon Reynolds described it as an attempt to construct a "lost [utopianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopianism "Utopianism")" rooted in visions of a benevolent post-[welfare state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state "Welfare state"). A sense of loss and bereavement is central to the phenomenon, according to theologian Johan Eddebo.

> [Simon Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Reynolds "Simon Reynolds") in 2011 remarked,

> There are those who say that hauntology’s moment has passed... that a good five or six years after the genre-not-genre coalesced, its set of reference points and sonic tropes has been worn threadbare. [...] how can you call time on a genre so [self-consciously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-consciously "Self-consciously") untimely? “Consensus to Delete” a/k/a the debate at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia "Wikipedia") about whether or not to erase the entry on ‘Hauntology (musical genre)’. In the end the shadowy cabal... decreed that Hauntology was too ontologically tenuous an entity to qualify for status as proper knowledge. It’s the kind of Moebius pretzel of preposterous-yet-faintly-sinister [discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse "Discourse") that [could have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_analysis "Discourse analysis") inspired an entire monograph by Michel “[Power/Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-knowledge "Power-knowledge")” [Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul-Michel_Foucault "Paul-Michel Foucault") or Jacques “[Archive Fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_Fever "Archive Fever")” Derrida. But look, look, how carefully and scrupulously they preserve (“do not modify”) the record of their own deliberations.

> Liam Sprod of _[3:AM Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3:AM_Magazine "3:AM Magazine")_ stated that "\[h]auntology as aesthetics is firmly rooted in the idea of [nostalgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia "Nostalgia") as a disruption of time," adding that "[i]nstead of mere repetition, this distance provides a sense of loss and mourning, [...] and revitalizes the potential for a utopianism for the present age". Mark Fisher characterised the hauntology movement as "a sign that 'white' culture can no longer escape the temporal disjunctions that have been constitutive of the [Afrodiasporic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_diaspora "African diaspora") experience", calling it contemporary [electronic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music "Electronic music")'s "confrontation with a cultural impasse: the failure of the future". Fisher stated that

> \[W]hen cultural innovation has stalled and even gone backwards, [...] one function of hauntology is to keep insisting that there are futures beyond [postmodernity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernity "Postmodernity")’s terminal time. When the present has given up on the future, we must listen for the relics of the future in the unactivated potentials of the past.

> Hauntological music is stated by academic Sean Albeiz to suggest "an [uncanny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny "Uncanny") mixture of shared but faded cultural memories with sinister undercurrents". Hauntology (along with the hypnagogic movement) was likened to "sonic fictions or intentional forgeries, creating half-baked memories of things that never were—approximating the imprecise nature of memory itself".
