> In various [occultist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultist "Occultist") movements, **Secret Chiefs** are said to be transcendent cosmic authorities, a spiritual hierarchy responsible for the operation and moral calibre of the [cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos "Cosmos"), or for overseeing the operations of an [esoteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esotericism "Esotericism") organization that manifests outwardly in the form of a [magical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_order "Magical order") or lodge system. Their names and descriptions have varied through time, differing among those who have claimed experience of contact with them. They are variously held to exist on higher [planes of being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planes_of_being "Planes of being") or to be [incarnate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarnate "Incarnate"); if incarnate, they may be described as being gathered at some special location, such as [Shambhala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambhala "Shambhala"), or scattered through the world working anonymously.

## History
>One early and influential source on these entities is [Karl von Eckartshausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Eckartshausen "Karl von Eckartshausen"), whose _The #Cloud upon the Sanctuary_, published in 1795, explained in some detail their character and motivations. Several 19th and 20th century [occultists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultism "Occultism") claimed to belong to or to have contacted these Secret Chiefs and made these communications known to others: Aleister Crowley (who used the term to refer to members of the upper three grades of his order, [[A∴A∴]]), [Dion Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_Fortune "Dion Fortune") (who called them the "esoteric order"), and [Max Heindel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Heindel "Max Heindel") (who called them the "Elder Brothers").
### Golden Dawn
> The _[[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]_ was founded by persons claiming to be in communication with the Secret Chiefs.
