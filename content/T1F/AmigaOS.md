### Scripting

> The AmigaOS has support for the [Rexx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx "Rexx")([[T-Rex]]) language, called ARexx (short for "Amiga Rexx"), and is a script language which allows for full OS scripting, similar to [AppleScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript "AppleScript"); intra-application scripting, similar to [VBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications "Visual Basic for Applications") in [Microsoft Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office "Microsoft Office"); as well as inter-program communication. Having a single scripting language for any application on the operating system is beneficial to users, instead of having to learn a new language for each application.

> Programs can listen on an "ARexx port" for string messages. These messages can then be interpreted by the program in a similar fashion to a user pushing buttons. For example, an ARexx script run in an e-mail program could save the currently displayed email, invoke an external program which could extract and process information, and then invoke a viewer program. This allows applications to control other applications by sending data back and forth directly with memory handles, instead of saving files to disk and then reloading them.

> Since AmigaOS 4, the [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)") language is included with the operating system.
