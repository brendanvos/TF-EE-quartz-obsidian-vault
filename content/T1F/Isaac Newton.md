>  Newton built the [first practical reflecting telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_telescope "Newtonian telescope") ([[Telescope]]) and developed a sophisticated [theory of colour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory "Color theory") based on the observation that a [prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersive_prism "Dispersive prism") separates [white light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum#Visible_radiation_(light) "Electromagnetic spectrum") into the colours of the [visible spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum "Visible spectrum"). His work on light was collected in his highly influential book _[Opticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opticks "Opticks")_, published in 1704. He also formulated an [empirical law of cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling "Newton's law of cooling"), made the first theoretical calculation of the [speed of sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound "Speed of sound"), and introduced the notion of a [Newtonian fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_fluid "Newtonian fluid"). In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the [binomial theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem "Binomial theorem") to non-integer exponents, developed [a method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method "Newton's method") for approximating the [roots of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function "Zero of a function"), and classified most of the [cubic plane curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_plane_curve "Cubic plane curve").

### Alchemy
>  Of an estimated ten million words of writing in Newton's papers, about one million deal with [[Alchemy]]. Many of Newton's writings on alchemy are copies of other manuscripts, with his own annotations. Alchemical texts mix artisanal knowledge with philosophical speculation, often hidden behind layers of wordplay, allegory, and imagery to protect craft secrets. Some of the content contained in Newton's papers could have been considered heretical by the church.
