In [ancient Greek religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_religion "Ancient Greek religion") and [mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology"), the **twelve Olympians** are the major [deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity "Deity") of the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology") [pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_(religion) "Pantheon (religion)"), commonly considered to be [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus "Zeus"), [Poseidon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poseidon "Poseidon"), [Hera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera "Hera"), [Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter "Demeter"), [Aphrodite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite "Aphrodite"), [Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena "Athena"), [Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis "Artemis"), [[Apollo (Greek+Roman God)|Apollo]], [Ares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares "Ares"), [Hephaestus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestus "Hephaestus"), [Hermes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes "Hermes"), and either [Hestia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hestia "Hestia") or [Dionysus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus "Dionysus"). They were called _Olympians_ because, according to tradition, they resided on [Mount Olympus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Olympus "Mount Olympus").

Besides the twelve Olympians, there were many other cultic groupings of twelve gods.

The Olympians were a race of [deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity "Deity"), primarily consisting of a third and fourth generation of immortal beings, worshipped as the principal gods of the Greek [pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_(religion) "Pantheon (religion)") and so named because of their residency atop [Mount Olympus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Olympus "Mount Olympus"). They gained their supremacy in a ten-year-long [war of gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanomachy "Titanomachy"), in which [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus "Zeus") led his siblings to victory over the previous generation of ruling immortal beings, the [[Titans]], children of the [primordial deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_primordial_deities "Greek primordial deities") [Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus_(mythology) "Uranus (mythology)") and [Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia "Gaia").
