**Leo** [/ˈliːoʊ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") is one of the [constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation "Constellation") of the [zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac "Zodiac"), between [Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_(constellation) "Cancer (constellation)") the crab to the west and [Virgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(constellation) "Virgo (constellation)") the maiden to the east. It is located in the [Northern celestial hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_celestial_hemisphere "Northern celestial hemisphere"). Its name is [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") for [[T1F/Lion]], and to the [ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greeks "Ancient Greeks") represented the [Nemean Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemean_Lion "Nemean Lion") killed by the mythical Greek hero [Heracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles "Heracles") as one of his [twelve labors.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Labours "Twelve Labours") Its old astronomical symbol is [![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Leo_symbol_%28fixed_width%29.svg/20px-Leo_symbol_%28fixed_width%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leo_symbol_(fixed_width).svg) (♌︎). One of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd-century astronomer [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy"), Leo remains one of the 88 modern constellations today, and one of the most easily recognizable due to its many bright stars and a distinctive shape that is reminiscent of the crouching lion it depicts. The lion's mane and shoulders also form an [asterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy) "Asterism (astronomy)") known as "The Sickle," which to modern observers may resemble a backwards "question mark."
