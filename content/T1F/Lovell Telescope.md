[[Telescope]]
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovell_Telescope "Lovell Telescope")

### The race to [[The Moon]]
> The telescope tracked [Luna 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_10 "Luna 10"), a Russian satellite put into orbit around the Moon, in April 1966, and [Zond 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zond_5 "Zond 5") in September 1968, a Russian probe containing two tortoises that was launched at the Moon, around which it sling-shotted before returning to Earth. The telescope did not track [[Apollo 11]], as it was tracking [Luna 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_15 "Luna 15") in July 1969. However, a 50 ft (15 m) telescope at Jodrell Bank was used at the same time to track [[Apollo 11]].

### 21cm hydrogen line
> Further information: [Hydrogen line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_line "Hydrogen line")

> The 21 cm hydrogen line was discovered during the telescope's construction; the telescope was subsequently redesigned so that it could observe at that frequency. Using this line emission, hydrogen clouds both in the Milky Way galaxy and in other galaxies can be observed; for example, the telescope discovered a large cloud around the [M81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_81 "Messier 81") and [M82](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_82 "Messier 82") galaxies. The motion of these clouds either towards or away from us either [redshifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift") or [blueshifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueshift "Blueshift") the line, allowing the velocity to the cloud to be measured. This provides a probe of the internal dynamics of galaxies, and can also provide a measurement of the [rate of expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space "Metric expansion of space") of the universe.
