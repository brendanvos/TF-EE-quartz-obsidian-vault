> In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **cardioid** (from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") _[_καρδιά_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%AC "wikt:καρδιά") (kardiá)_ 'heart') is a [plane curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_curve "Plane curve") traced by a point on the perimeter of a circle that is rolling around a fixed circle of the same radius. It can also be defined as an [epicycloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycloid "Epicycloid") having a single [cusp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusp_(singularity) "Cusp (singularity)"). It is also a type of [sinusoidal spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusoidal_spiral "Sinusoidal spiral"), and an [inverse curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_curve "Inverse curve") of the [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola") with the focus as the center of inversion. A cardioid can also be defined as the set of points of reflections of a fixed point on a circle through all tangents to the circle.

>Cardioid generated by a rolling circle on a circle with the same radius

> The name was coined by [Giovanni Salvemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Salvemini "Giovanni Salvemini") in 1741 but the cardioid had been the subject of study decades beforehand. Although named for its #heart -like form, it is shaped more like the outline of the cross-section of a round [apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple "Apple") without the stalk.
