### Chinese mythology
In [Chinese mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_mythology "Chinese mythology"), a carving of a tree of life depicts a [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] and a [dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon "Chinese dragon"); the dragon often represents immortality. A [[Taoism|Taoist]] story tells of a tree that produces a [peach of immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaches_of_immortality "Peaches of immortality") every three thousand years, and anyone who eats the fruit receives immortality.

An [archaeological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological "Archaeological") discovery in the 1990s was of a sacrificial pit at [Sanxingdui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanxingdui "Sanxingdui") in [Sichuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan "Sichuan"), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"). Dating from about 1200 [BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era "Common Era"), it contained three [bronze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze "Bronze") trees, one of them 4 meters high. At the base was a dragon, and fruit hanging from the lower branches. At the top is a bird-like (Phoenix) creature with claws. Also found in Sichuan, from the late [Han dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty "Han dynasty") (c 25 – 220 CE), is another tree of life. The [ceramic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic "Ceramic") base is guarded by a horned beast with wings. The leaves of the tree represent coins and people. At the apex is a bird with coins ([[Gold Coins]]?) and [[The Sun]].

Judaic [[Kabbalah tree of life]] 10 _[Sefirot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefirot "Sefirot")_, through which the _[Ein Sof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein_Sof "Ein Sof")_ unknowable divine manifests Creation. The configuration relates to [man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kadmon "Adam Kadmon")

>Jewish [mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism "Mysticism") depicts the tree of life in the form of ten interconnected nodes, as the central symbol of the [Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah "Kabbalah"). It comprises the ten _[Sefirot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefirot "Sefirot")_ powers in the divine realm. The [panentheistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panentheistic "Panentheistic") and [anthropomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism_in_Kabbalah "Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah") emphasis of this [emanationist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanationism "Emanationism") theology interpreted the Torah, Jewish observance, and the purpose of Creation as the symbolic esoteric drama of unification in the _Sefirot_, restoring harmony to Creation. From the time of the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance") onwards, Jewish Kabbalah became incorporated as an important tradition in non-Jewish Western culture, first through its adoption by left-hand path, goy qabalah, and continuing in [Western esotericism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_esotericism "Western esotericism") occult [[Hermetic Qabalah]]. These adapted the pre-Judaic, right-hand path Kabbalah tree of life [syncretically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism "Syncretism") by associating it with other religious traditions, esoteric theologies, and magical practices. The Tree of Death is the Tree of Life with its 10 Sephirot qlipped off, retaining only the 22 branches and 3 trunks of the Tree of Life.
