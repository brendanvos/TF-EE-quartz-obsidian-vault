> The term "chill-out music" – originally conflated with "[ambient house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_house "Ambient house")" – came from an area called "The White Room" at the [Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_(nightclub) "Heaven (nightclub)") nightclub in London in 1989. There, DJs played ambient mixes from sources such as [[Brian Eno]] and [[Pink Floyd]] to allow dancers a place to "chill out" from the faster-paced music of the main dance floor. Ambient house became widely popular over the next decade before it declined due to [market saturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_saturation).

> In the early 2000s, DJs in [Ibiza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibiza "Ibiza")'s [Café Del Mar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Del_Mar "Café Del Mar") began creating ambient house mixes that drew on jazz, classical, Hispanic, and [New Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_age_music "New age music") sources. The popularity of chill-out subsequently expanded to dedicated [[Satellite radio]] channels, outdoor festivals, and thousands of [compilation albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilation_album "Compilation album"). "Chill-out" was also removed from its ambient origins and became its own distinct genre.
