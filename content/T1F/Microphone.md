### Cardioid, hypercardioid, supercardioid, subcardioid
The most common unidirectional microphone is a **cardioid** microphone, so named because the sensitivity pattern is "heart-shaped" (i.e. a [[cardioid]]). The cardioid family of microphones are commonly used as vocal or speech microphones since they are good at rejecting sounds from other directions. In three dimensions, the cardioid is shaped like an apple centered around the microphone, which is the "stem" of the apple. The cardioid response reduces pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid feedback from the [monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foldback_(sound_engineering) "Foldback (sound engineering)"). Since these directional transducer microphones achieve their patterns by sensing pressure gradient, putting them very close to the sound source (at distances of a few centimeters) results in a bass boost due to the increased gradient. This is known as the [proximity effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_effect_(audio) "Proximity effect (audio)"). The SM58 has been the most commonly used microphone for live vocals for more than 50 years demonstrating the importance and popularity of cardioid mics.
