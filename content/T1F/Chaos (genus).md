> The genus _Chaos_ has had a long and often confusing history. In 1755, [Rösel von Rosenhof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Johann_R%C3%B6sel_von_Rosenhof "August Johann Rösel von Rosenhof") saw and depicted an amoeboid he named "_der kleine Proteus_" ("the little [[Proteus (Greek god)|Proteus]]"). Three years later, Linnaeus gave Rösel's creature the name _Volvox chaos_. However, because the name _[Volvox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvox "Volvox")_ had already been applied to a genus of flagellate algae, he later changed it to _Chaos chaos_. In subsequent decades, as new names and species proliferated, accounts of _Chaos_, under a variety of synonyms, became so thoroughly entangled with descriptions of similar organisms, that it is virtually impossible to differentiate one historic amoeboid from another. In 1879, Joseph Leidy suggested collapsing all the "common" large, freshwater amoebae into one species, which he proposed to call _[Amoeba proteus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba_proteus "Amoeba proteus")_. A dozen species, including several that had been identified as belonging to _Chaos_, were to be regarded as synonyms of _Amoeba proteus_. However, in the description he gives of this organism, it is clearly defined as a [uninucleate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninucleate "Uninucleate") amoeba, unlike the modern _Chaos_.
