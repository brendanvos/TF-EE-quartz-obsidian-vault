	The **egg cell**, or **ovum** (plural **ova**), is the [female](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female "Female") [reproductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction "Reproduction") cell, or [gamete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete "Gamete"), in most [anisogamous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisogamous "Anisogamous") organisms (organisms that [reproduce sexually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduce_sexually "Reproduce sexually") with a larger, female gamete and a smaller, male one). The term is used when the female gamete is not capable of movement (non-[motile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motile "Motile")). If the male gamete ([sperm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm "Sperm")) is capable of movement, the type of sexual reproduction is also classified as [oogamous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oogamous "Oogamous"). A nonmotile female gamete formed in the oogonium of some algae, fungi, oomycetes, or bryophytes is an **oosphere**. When fertilized the oosphere becomes the [oospore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oospore "Oospore").

> When egg and sperm fuse during [fertilisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation "Fertilisation"), a [diploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid "Diploid") cell (the [zygote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygote "Zygote")) is formed, which rapidly grows into a new organism.

### Ooplasm
> Ooplasm (also: oöplasm) is the [yolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolk "Yolk") of the ovum, a cell substance at its center, which contains its [nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus "Cell nucleus"), named the [germinal vesicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germinal_vesicle "Germinal vesicle"), and the [nucleolus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleolus "Nucleolus"), called the [germinal disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germinal_disc "Germinal disc").

> The ooplasm consists of the [cytoplasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm "Cytoplasm") of the ordinary animal cell with its [spongioplasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spongioplasm&action=edit&redlink=1 "Spongioplasm (page does not exist)") and [hyaloplasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaloplasm "Hyaloplasm"), often called the _formative yolk_; and the _nutritive yolk_ or _deutoplasm_, made of rounded granules of fatty and [albuminoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin "Albumin") substances imbedded in the cytoplasm.

> [Mammalian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal "Mammal") ova contain only a tiny amount of the nutritive yolk, for nourishing the [embryo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo "Embryo") in the early stages of its development only. In contrast, bird eggs contain enough to supply the chick with nutriment throughout the whole period of incubation ( [[Incubator]] ).
