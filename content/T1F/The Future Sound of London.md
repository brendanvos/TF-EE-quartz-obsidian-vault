	Album _[[The Far-Out Son of Lung and the Ramblings of a Madman]]_ 

 > **The Future Sound of London** (often abbreviated **FSOL**) is a British [electronic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music "Electronic music") duo composed of [Garry Cobain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Cobain "Garry Cobain") and [Brian Dougans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dougans "Brian Dougans"). They have been described as a "boundary-pushing" electronic act, covering [techno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno "Techno"), [ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music "Ambient music"), [house music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music "House music"), [trip hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trip_hop "Trip hop"), [psychedelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_music "Psychedelic music"), and [dub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_music "Dub music").

> While keeping an enigmatic image and releasing music under many aliases, the band found commercial success with singles "[[Papua New Guinea (FSOL album)]]" (1991), "[Cascade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_(song) "Cascade (song)")" (1993), and albums _[Lifeforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeforms_(The_Future_Sound_of_London_album) "Lifeforms (The Future Sound of London album)")_ (1994) and _[Dead Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Cities_(album) "Dead Cities (album)")_ (1996). In recent years, the duo has become more candid with their fanbase online.

## History
### New millennium
> After a four-year hiatus, rumours of [mental illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_illness "Mental illness") began to spread which turned out to be nothing more than exaggeration of Cobain's [mercury poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_poisoning "Mercury poisoning") ([[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]) from fillings in his teeth. Cobain gained much from the experience, realising that music was a tool for psychic exploration and entertainment but also one for healing. The pair returned in 2002 with _"[The Isness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Isness "The Isness")"_, a record heavily influenced by 1960s and 1970s [psychedelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelia "Psychedelia") and released under their alias Amorphous Androgynous. It was preceded by _[Papua New Guinea Translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea_(song)#%22Translations%22 "Papua New Guinea (song)")_, a mini album which contained a mixture of remixes of FSOL's track as well as new material from _The Isness_ sessions. The album received mixed press due to the drastic change in sound which was inspired by Cobain's and Dougan's (separate) travels to India and immersion in spiritualism, nevertheless the majority was positive with _[Muzik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzik "Muzik")_ magazine offering the album a 6/5 mark and dubbing it "...a white beam of light from heaven..." and other British publications such as _[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times "The Times")_, _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")_ and _[MOJO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_(magazine) "Mojo (magazine)")_ praising the album and the band's ability to do something so completely different from what they had done before.

>Three years on, they followed the album with a continuation of the Amorphous Androgynous project, _[Alice in Ultraland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Ultraland "Alice in Ultraland")_ ([[Alice in Wonderland]], #Ultra). Rumoured to be accompanied by a film of the same title, the album took _The Isness_' psychedelic experimentation and toned it down, giving the album a singular theme and sound, and replacing the more bizarre moments with [funk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk_music "Funk music") and ambient interludes. The album was ignored by the press, but was received more favourably among fans than its predecessor. Unlike _The Isness_, which featured almost 100 musicians over the course of it and the various alternative versions and [remix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix "Remix") albums, _Alice in Ultraland_ featured a fairly solid band lineup throughout, which extended to live shows which the band had undertaken away from the ISDN cables from 2005 onwards.
>...
>In 1992, Cobain and Dougans released their debut, techno-driven album together, _[Accelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerator_(The_Future_Sound_of_London_album) "Accelerator (The Future Sound of London album)")_. It was followed by "[Papua New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea_(song) "Papua New Guinea (song)")", a single based on a [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music) "Sampling (music)") from "[Dawn of the Iconoclast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Within_the_Realm_of_a_Dying_Sun "Within the Realm of a Dying Sun")" ( #Dawn) by [Dead Can Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Can_Dance "Dead Can Dance"), and a bassline from "Radio [[Babylon]]" by [Meat Beat Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_Beat_Manifesto "Meat Beat Manifesto"). In 1992, after the chart success and several accolades of "Papua New Guinea", [Virgin Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Records "Virgin Records") signed the band with free rein to experiment. 

### _Lifeforms_ and the _ISDN_ tour
> In 1993, the band released "[Cascade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_(song) "Cascade (song)")," a nearly 40 minutes single made the UK top 30. It was followed in 1994 by the album _[Lifeforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeforms_(The_Future_Sound_of_London_album) "Lifeforms (The Future Sound of London album)")_, released to critical acclaim and a top 10 hit on the UK album chart. The [eponymous single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeforms_(song) "Lifeforms (song)") featured [Elizabeth Fraser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Fraser "Elizabeth Fraser") of the [Cocteau Twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocteau_Twins "Cocteau Twins") on vocals. The record introduced an array of exotic, tropical sound samples. Dougans' father's involvement in the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] had a heavy influence on _Lifeforms_. Often asked whether [[Brian Eno]] was an influence, Cobain and Dougans said they were about looking to the future not the past. To them, [[Lifeforms (FSOL album)]]( [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeforms_(The_Future_Sound_of_London_album) "Lifeforms (The Future Sound of London album)")) was a new work not just another Eno-type ambient album.
>
> That year, the Future Sound of London released a limited-edition album _[ISDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDN_(album) "ISDN (album)")_, which featured live broadcasts made over [ISDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDN "ISDN") lines to various radio stations worldwide to promote _Lifeforms_, including [The Kitchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kitchen "The Kitchen"), an avant-garde performance space in New York, and several appearances on BBC _Sessions_ hosted by [John Peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel "John Peel"). The shows featured ambient soundscapes with previously released material performed alongside unheard tracks. One performance for [[BBC Radio 1]] featured [Robert Fripp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp "Robert Fripp"). The tone of _ISDN_ was darker and more rhythmic than _Lifeforms_. The band wanted to achieve something epic and grand, but no matter how much technological or personal support they had they never got to truly do what they envisioned. Cobain said that the 90s were a time of frustration because the technology didn't fit the band's ideas. In 1995, the album was re-released with expanded artwork and a slightly altered track list.
>
> The band's interests have covered different areas including film and video, [2D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics "2D computer graphics") and [3D computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics "3D computer graphics"), [animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation "Animation") in making almost all their own videos for their singles, radio broadcasting and creating electronic devices for sound making.

## Independence
> Since the millennium, FSOL took a more independent turn with their career, releasing their more psychedelic _Amorphous Androgynous_ on an independent label, _The Isness_ on Artful Records and _Alice in Ultraland_ on the progressive [[Harvest Records]] (an arm of [EMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI "EMI")). They also have their own label called _Electronic Brain Violence_ on which off-beat electronic artists such as Oil and Simon Wells (Headstone Lane) have released EPs and singles. Simon Wells also contributed to _Dead Cities_ on the track "Dead Cities Reprise"

> Nevertheless, Virgin records still controls FSOL's back catalog and was going to release the _Teachings from the Electronic Brain_ compilation without them, but the duo insisted on taking control of the production of the project. Cobain says that, even with Virgin, the reason they were able to do their own thing and create the music they wanted in the 1990s was because they already had some major hits under their belts such as "Papua New Guinea", "Metropolis" and "Stakker Humanoid" before joining the label.
