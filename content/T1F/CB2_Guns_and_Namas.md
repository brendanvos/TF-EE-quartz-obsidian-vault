# 1) Communes of Dande
Caxito
Kikabo
Mabubas
Úcua ( #Unsolved )

The text Úcua has yet to be uncovered by hunters, it was unfound until revealed in a [message from Rob](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1152987061251485756).

"Dande" combines with the next clue "lion" to form "dandelion"
# 2) MAMMALIA FERÆ. Felis.   41   R12
![[SystemaNatura_page41_line12.png]]
The twelfth line describes "Leo" aka the lion.
This was unsolved until revealed in a [message from Rob](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1152987170529890484).

Combined with the communes of *Dande* we get Dande Lion, likely a clue pointing us to the color yellow.
# 3) B. and β.
Once we find the missing "A." from [[CB2_Couple]] we can overlay the images and draw the cross connecting the four letters as described in a [message from Rob](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1152988352400855091).
# 4) Dandelion seed
Another dandelion clue likely pointing to the color yellow.
# 5) X
#Unsolved 
It is possible this is simply an X on a yellow color pointing to "yolk".
# 6) Morse code
#Unsolved
The bottom-most line of suspected morse has been interpreted to be "TRENTREO" ([message](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1131760236236111924)).
An actor by the name [Kawakawa Fox-Reo](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10752352/?ref_=tt_ch) played the character Trent in the show Wellington Paranormal. 
This could be a clue towards Fox (AKA, Vulpe), however there is no known direct link to the password for the tier.
This has not been confirmed as correct by Rob.

The top three dots, as well as the dot directly above the "TRENTREO" morse have all been interpreted as Es ([message](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1149488405634355300)).
This likely points to EEE -> Three 'E's -> E=3.
# 7) Green pixels on AK
#Unsolved
# 8) 19px, 77px, 6px, 18px Bars
#Unsolved
# 9) Blue/green 1px border
#Unsolved 
These border pixels are an exact mirror across the vertical axis of those present in [[CB2_Couple]].
# 10) Unknown symbol and text
#Unsolved 
This surface on the AK seems to have a symbol on the majority of it, with text across the bottom.
We have been unable to produce clear enough images to understand what is here.
