> **Midas** ([/ˈmaɪdəs/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"); [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): Μίδας) was the name of a [[King]] in [Phrygia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygia "Phrygia") with whom several myths became associated, as well as two later members of the Phrygian royal house.

> The most famous **King Midas** is popularly remembered in [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology")  #Greek for his ability to turn everything he touched into [[Gold]]. This came to be called the _golden touch_, or the _Midas touch_. The legends told about this Midas and his father [Gordias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordias "Gordias"), credited with founding the Phrygian capital city [Gordium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordium "Gordium") and tying the [Gordian Knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot "Gordian Knot"), indicate that they were believed to have lived sometime in the 2nd millennium BC, well before the [Trojan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War "Trojan War"). However, [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer "Homer") does not mention Midas or [Gordias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordias "Gordias"), while instead mentioning two other Phrygian kings, [Mygdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mygdon_of_Phrygia "Mygdon of Phrygia") and Otreus.

> The Phrygian city [Midaeum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midaeum "Midaeum") was presumably named after him, and this is probably also the Midas that according to [Pausanias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pausanias_(geographer) "Pausanias (geographer)") founded Ancyra (today known as [Ankara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara "Ankara")).

> Another King Midas ruled Phrygia in the late 8th century BC. Most historians believe this Midas is the same person as the _Mita_, called king of the [Mushki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushki "Mushki") in Assyrian texts, who warred with [Assyria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria "Assyria") and its [Anatolian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Anatolians "Ancient Anatolians") provinces during the same period. A third Midas is said by [Herodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus "Herodotus") to have been a member of the royal house of Phrygia in the 6th century BC

> There are many, and often contradictory, legends about the most ancient King Midas. In one, Midas was king of [Pessinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pessinus "Pessinus"), a city of [Phrygia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygia "Phrygia"), who as a child was adopted by King [Gordias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordias "Gordias") and [Cybele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybele "Cybele"), the [goddess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddess "Goddess") whose consort he was, and who (by some accounts) was the goddess-mother of Midas himself. Some accounts place the youth of Midas in [Macedonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedon "Macedon") Bermion (see [Bryges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryges "Bryges")). In [Thracian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrace "Thrace") [Mygdonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mygdonia_(Europe) "Mygdonia (Europe)"), [Herodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus "Herodotus") referred to a wild rose garden at the foot of Mount Bermion as "the garden of Midas son of Gordias, where [[Roses]] grow of themselves, each bearing sixty blossoms and of surpassing fragrance". Herodotus says elsewhere that Phrygians anciently lived in Europe where they were known as [Bryges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryges "Bryges"), and the existence of the garden implies that Herodotus believed that Midas lived prior to a Phrygian migration to Anatolia.

> Herodotus said that a "Midas son of Gordias" made an offering to the [Oracle of Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_of_Delphi "Oracle of Delphi") of a royal throne "from which he made judgments" that were "well worth seeing", and that this Midas was the only foreigner to make an offering to Delphi before [Gyges of Lydia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyges_of_Lydia "Gyges of Lydia"). The historical Midas of the 8th century BC and [Gyges of Lydia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyges_of_Lydia "Gyges of Lydia") are believed to have been contemporaries, so it seems most likely that Herodotus believed that the throne was donated by the earlier, legendary King Midas. However, some historians believe that this throne was donated by the later, historical King Midas, great grandfather of [Alyattes of Lydia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyattes_of_Lydia "Alyattes of Lydia") who was also referred to as Midas after amassing huge wealth from inventing taxable coinage using [[Electrum]] sourced from Midas' famed river [Pactolus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pactolus "Pactolus").

### Golden Touch
> One day, as [[Publius Ovidius Naso|Ovid]] relates in _[Metamorphoses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphoses_(poem) "Metamorphoses (poem)")_ XI, [Dionysus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus "Dionysus") found that his old schoolmaster and foster father, the [satyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr "Satyr") [Silenus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silenus "Silenus"), was missing. The old satyr had been drinking wine and wandered away drunk, to be found by some Phrygian [peasants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasant "Peasant") who carried him to their king, Midas (alternatively, Silenus passed out in Midas' rose garden). Midas recognized him and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with politeness, while Silenus delighted Midas and his friends with stories and songs. On the eleventh day, he took Silenus back to Dionysus in [Lydia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia "Lydia"). Dionysus offered Midas his choice of whatever reward he wished for. Midas asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into [[gold]].


### Ears of a donkey

>Midas, now hating wealth and splendor, moved to the country and became a worshipper of [Pan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(god) "Pan (god)"), the god of the fields and satyrs. Roman mythographers asserted that his tutor in music was [Orpheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus "Orpheus").

> Once, Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of [[Apollo (Greek+Roman God)|Apollo]], and challenged Apollo to a trial of skill (also see [Marsyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsyas "Marsyas")). [Tmolus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmolus_(son_of_Ares) "Tmolus (son of Ares)"), the mountain-god, was chosen as umpire. Pan blew on his pipes and, with his rustic melody, gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present. Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but one agreed with the judgment. Midas dissented, and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and said "Must have ears of an ass!", which caused Midas's ears to become those of a [donkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey "Donkey"). The myth is illustrated by two paintings, _"Apollo and Marsyas"_ by [Palma il Giovane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_il_Giovane "Palma il Giovane") (1544–1628), one depicting the scene before, and one after, the punishment. Midas was mortified at this mishap. He attempted to hide his misfortune under an ample turban or headdress, but his [barber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber "Barber") of course knew the secret, so was told not to mention it. However, the barber could not keep the secret. He went out into a meadow, dug a hole in the ground, whispered the story into it, then covered the hole up. A thick bed of reeds later sprang up from the covered up hole, and began whispering the story, saying "King Midas has an ass's ears". Some sources, such as [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch"), say that Midas committed suicide by drinking [bull's blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realgar "Realgar"), a powdered crystal substance which was used in the ancient world as pigment for red paint, but very toxic due to its high level of arsenic.

> Sarah Morris demonstrated (Morris, 2004) that donkeys' ears were a Bronze Age royal attribute, borne by King [Tarkasnawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarkasnawa "Tarkasnawa") (Greek Tarkondemos) of [Mira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arzawa "Arzawa"), on a seal inscribed in both [Hittite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittite_language "Hittite language") cuneiform and [Luwian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luwian "Luwian") hieroglyphs. In this connection, the myth would appear for Greeks to justify the exotic attribute.

> The stories of the contests with Apollo of Pan and Marsyas were very often confused, so [Titian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titian "Titian")'s _[Flaying of Marsyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaying_of_Marsyas_(Titian) "Flaying of Marsyas (Titian)")_ includes a figure of Midas (who may be a self-portrait), though his ears seem normal.
