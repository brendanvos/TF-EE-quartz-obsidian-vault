> **CygnusEd** is a [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor "Text editor") for the [[AmigaOS]] and [MorphOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MorphOS "MorphOS"). It was first developed in 1986-1987 by Bruce Dawson, Colin Fox and Steve LaRocque who were working for CygnusSoft Software. It was the first Amiga text editor with an undo/redo feature and one of the first Amiga programs that had an [AREXX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AREXX "AREXX") scripting port by which it was possible to integrate the editor with AREXX enabled C compilers and build a semi-[integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment "Integrated development environment"). Many Amiga programmers grew up with CygnusEd and a considerable part of the Amiga software library was created with CygnusEd. It is still one of very few text editors that support jerkyless [soft scrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrolling "Scrolling").

> It remained popular even after [Commodore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_International "Commodore International")'s bankruptcy in 1994. In 1997 version 4 was developed by Olaf Barthel and was ported to MorphOS by [Ralph Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Schmidt&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ralph Schmidt (page does not exist)") in 2000 and made available for users having the original CygnusED 4 CDROM. In 2007 version 5 was finished by Olaf Barthel again, which runs natively on AmigaOS 2 and [AmigaOS 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmigaOS_4 "AmigaOS 4").
