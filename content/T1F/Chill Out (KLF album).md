### Identified Samples
> The samples used in _Chill Out_ contribute fundamentally to the character of the composition. In particular, the recurring sampled sound effects of [rolling stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_stock "Rolling stock") and other transport illustrate the journey concept, often during segues between parts of the composition. Many of these effects are taken from the 1987 CD version of [Elektra Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_Records "Elektra Records")' _Authentic Sound Effects Volume 2_. The tracks used are "Crossing Bells and Horn with Electric Train Pass" and "Short Freight Train Pass", along with processed versions of "F18 [[Diamond]] Fly-By", "Dodge Van Starts, Drives Out", and "Surf". Samples of American, British and Russian radio stations are also used, including the [BBC pips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_pips "BBC pips") and a jingle from [Tommy Vance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Vance "Tommy Vance")'s _[Friday Rock Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_Rock_Show "Friday Rock Show")_ on [[BBC Radio 1]]: "Rock radio into the nineties and beyond". Some of the more obscure sounds (Tuvan throat singers and Basque shepherds in the Pyrenees) come from the Saydisc Records soundtrack of the 1980s _[Disappearing World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearing_World_(TV_series) "Disappearing World (TV series)")_ series on Granada TV in the UK. The phrase "Your feeling of helplessness is your best friend, savage" is taken from the 1957 science fiction film _[The Brain from Planet Arous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brain_from_Planet_Arous "The Brain from Planet Arous")_ ( #brain ).

> The album features samples of distinctive melodies from the musical recordings of other artists: [Elvis Presley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley "Elvis Presley")'s 1969 UK No. 2 single "[In the Ghetto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Ghetto "In the Ghetto")", [Fleetwood Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac "Fleetwood Mac")'s 1968 UK No. 1 single "[Albatross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross_(instrumental) "Albatross (instrumental)")", as well as "[Oh Well Part II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Well_(song) "Oh Well (song)")", and [Acker Bilk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acker_Bilk "Acker Bilk")'s 1961 US No. 1 single "[Stranger on the Shore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_on_the_Shore "Stranger on the Shore")" all feature prominently, in each case set to an accompaniment of original music. The composers of these [hits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_single "Hit single") receive co-writing credit for "Elvis on the Radio Steel Guitar in My Soul", "3am Somewhere out of Beaumont", and "A Melody from a Past Life Keeps Pulling Me Back" respectively, and the performers are thanked in the _Chill Out_ sleevenotes. [Boy George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_George "Boy George")'s band [Jesus Loves You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Loves_You_(band) "Jesus Loves You (band)") is also thanked for a sample from the single "After the Love" ( #love ), which also features on "3am Somewhere out of Beaumont". Short samples from the [Van Halen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen "Van Halen") instrumental "[Eruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruption_(instrumental) "Eruption (instrumental)")" emerge throughout the song "A Melody from a Past Life Keeps Pulling Me Back". Shortly after the 2:00 mark of "The Lights of Baton Rouge Pass By", a sample from the theme music of the 1958 film _[The Big Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Country "The Big Country")_ can be heard as well as "[Pacific State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_State_(song) "Pacific State (song)")" by [808 State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/808_State "808 State").

### Themes
> The use of a journey as a unifying musical or conceptual thread featured several times in Cauty and Drummond's work, including _[The White Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Room_(KLF_album) "The White Room (KLF album)")_, "[Last Train to Trancentral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Train_to_Trancentral "Last Train to Trancentral")", "[Justified and Ancient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justified_and_Ancient "Justified and Ancient")" and "[America: What Time Is Love?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America:_What_Time_Is_Love%3F "America: What Time Is Love?")" ( #love ). Cauty's _[[Space (Jimmy Cauty album)|Space]]_ and [[The Orb]]'s debut album, _[[Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld]]_- also employ the journey concept.

### Legacy
> In February 2021, the KLF released _[Come Down Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Down_Dawn "Come Down Dawn")_ ( #Dawn ), a reworking of _Chill Out_ with a selection of prominent but unlicensed samples from the original release removed.

### Track Listing
> The track listing of _Chill Out_ uses the start- and end-points of the parts, instead of the conventional track numbering system, indicating that the album be treated as a single composition. For the original KLF Communications CD release, the entire album was written to one track.
