## Origins
### Whore of [[Babylon]]

_[Whore of Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon")_. Painted by [Gnostic Saint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesia_Gnostica_Catholica "Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica") [William Blake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake "William Blake") in 1809.

>The [Whore of Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon") is referred to in several places in the [Book of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation"), a book which may have had an influence on [Thelema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema "Thelema"), as Aleister Crowley says he read it as a child and imagined himself as the [Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_(Revelation) "The Beast (Revelation)"). She is described in Chapter 17:3-6:

> So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with [[gold]] and [precious stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_stones "Precious stones") and [[pearl]]s, having a [golden cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_cup "Golden cup") in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her [fornication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornication "Fornication"): And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.

> Aleister Crowley recorded his view of the Book of Revelation in _The Vision and the Voice_.

> All I get is that the Apocalypse was the recension of a dozen or so totally disconnected allegories, that were pieced together, and ruthlessly planed down to make them into a connected account; and that recension was re-written and edited in the interests of Christianity, because people were complaining that Christianity could show no true spiritual knowledge, or any food for the best minds: nothing but miracles, which only deceived the most ignorant, and Theology, which only suited pedants.
> 
> So a man got hold of this recension, and turned it Christian, and imitated the style of John. And this explains why the end of the world does not happen every few years, as advertised.

## Great Mother
>Within the [Gnostic Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber_XV,_The_Gnostic_Mass "Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass"), Babalon is mentioned in the Gnostic Creed:

> And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all, and in one Womb wherein all men are begotten, and wherein they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery, in Her name BABALON.

>Here, Babalon is identified with [Binah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binah_(Kabbalah) "Binah (Kabbalah)") on the [[Tree of Life]], the sphere that represents the Great Sea and such mother-goddesses as [Isis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis "Isis"), [Bhavani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhavani "Bhavani"), and [Ma'at](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%27at "Ma'at"). Moreover, she represents all physical mothers. Bishops T. Apiryon and Helena write:

> BABALON, as the Great Mother, represents MATTER, a word which is derived from the Latin word for Mother. She is the physical mother of each of us, the one who provided us with material flesh to clothe our naked spirits; She is the Archetypal Mother, the Great Yoni, the Womb of all that lives through the flowing of Blood; She is the Great Sea, the Divine Blood itself which cloaks the World and which courses through our veins; and She is Mother Earth, the Womb of All Life that we know

### Gateway to the City of [[Pyramids]] (12th Aethyr) #Num12
Main article: [A∴A∴ § Milestones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4#Milestones "A∴A∴")
> Within the mystical system of the [A∴A∴](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4 "A∴A∴"), after the adept has attained the Knowledge and Conversation of his [Holy Guardian Angel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Guardian_Angel "Holy Guardian Angel"), he then might reach the next and last great milestone – the crossing of the [Abyss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyss_(Thelema) "Abyss (Thelema)"), that great spiritual wilderness of nothingness and dissolution. [Choronzon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choronzon "Choronzon") is the dweller there, and its job is to trap the traveler in his meaningless world of illusion.

> However, Babalon is just on the other side, beckoning. If the adept gives himself totally to her – the symbol of this act being the pouring of the adept's blood into her graal – he becomes impregnated in her, then to be reborn as a Master of the Temple and a saint that dwells in the [City of the Pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_the_Pyramids "City of the Pyramids"). From Crowley's book _[Magick Without Tears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_Without_Tears "Magick Without Tears")_:

> \[S]he guardeth the #Abyss. And in her is a perfect purity of that which is above, yet she is sent as the Redeemer to them that are below. For there is no other way into the Supernal mystery but through her and the Beast on which she rideth. She cannot say no. Her decisions are devoid of authority. She is the fruit that will grow in a sea of darkness, the seed of light that the great Samael Satan has taken. The seed that will be the weapon that will make all the damned surpass the old god.

>and from _[The Vision and the Voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vision_and_the_Voice "The Vision and the Voice")_ (12th Aethyr):

> Let him look upon the cup whose blood is mingled therein, for the wine of the cup is the blood of the saints. Glory unto the Scarlet Woman, Babalon the Mother of Abominations, that rideth upon the Beast, for she hath spilt their blood in every corner of the earth and lo! she hath mingled it in the cup of her whoredom.

> She is considered to be a sacred whore because she denies no one, and yet she extracts a great price — the very blood of the adept and their ego-identity as an earthly individual. This aspect of Babalon is described further from the 12th Aethyr:

> This is the Mystery of Babylon, the Mother of Abominations, and this is the mystery of her adulteries, for she hath yielded up herself to everything that liveth, and hath become a partaker in its mystery. And because she hath made her self the servant of each, therefore is she become the mistress of all. Not as yet canst thou comprehend her glory.
> 
> Beautiful art thou, O Babylon, and desirable, for thou hast given thyself to everything that liveth, and thy weakness hath subdued their strength. For in that union thou didst _understand_. Therefore art thou called Understanding, O Babylon, Lady of the Night!

### Cup of Babalon (5th Aethyr)
> The concept contained within this aspect of Babalon is that of the mystical ideal, the quest to become one with all through the annihilation of the earthly ego ("For as thy blood is mingled in the cup of BABALON, so is thine heart the universal heart."). The blood spilling into the graal of Babalon is then used by her to "flood the world with Life and Beauty" (meaning to create Masters of the Temple that are "released" back into the world of men), symbolized by the [Crimson Rose of 49 Petals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosy_Cross).

> In [sex magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_magic "Sex magic"), the mixture of [female sexual fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_lubrication "Vaginal lubrication") and [semen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen "Semen") produced in the sexual act with the Scarlet Woman or Babalon is called the elixir of life ([[Philosopher's stone]]). Another alternative form of this elixir is the _Elixir Rubeus_ consisting of the [menstrual blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation "Menstruation") and [semen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen "Semen") (abbreviated as _El. Rub._ by Crowley in his magical diaries), and is referred to as the "effluvium of Babalon, the Scarlet Woman, which is the menstruum of the lunar current" by [Kenneth Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Grant "Kenneth Grant").
