> The **Great Sphinx of Giza** is a [[T1F/Limestone]] statue of a reclining [sphinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx "Sphinx"), a [mythical creature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendary_creature "Legendary creature") with the head of a human and the body of a [[T1F/Lion]]. Facing directly from west to east, it stands on the [Giza Plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza_Plateau "Giza Plateau") on the west bank of the [Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile "Nile") in [Giza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza "Giza"), [[Egypt]]. The face of the Sphinx appears to represent the [pharaoh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh "Pharaoh") [Khafre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khafre "Khafre"). The original shape of the Sphinx was cut from the [bedrock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedrock "Bedrock"), and has since been restored with layers of [limestone blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone_block "Limestone block"). It measures 73 m (240 ft) long from paw to tail, 20 m (66 ft) high from the base to the top of the head and 19 m (62 ft) wide at its rear haunches.

> The Sphinx is the oldest known [monumental sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monumental_sculpture "Monumental sculpture") in Egypt and one of the most recognizable statues in the world. The archaeological evidence suggests that it was created by ancient Egyptians of the [Old Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Kingdom "Old Kingdom") during the reign of Khafre (c. 2558–2532 BC).

> The circumstances surrounding the Sphinx's nose being broken off are uncertain, but close inspection suggests a deliberate act using rods or chisels. Contrary to a [popular myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_myths "Popular myths"), it was not broken off by cannonfire from [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon "Napoleon")'s troops during his 1798 [Egyptian campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_campaign "Egyptian campaign"). Its absence is in fact depicted in artwork predating Napoleon, and referred to in descriptions by the 15th-century historian [al-Maqrīzī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Maqr%C4%ABz%C4%AB "Al-Maqrīzī").
