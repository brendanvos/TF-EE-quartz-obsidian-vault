All known clues hidden in this image can be seen by applying a PCA distance projection of component 3, as seen above. This can be done using either [forensically](https://29a.ch/photo-forensics) or [sherloq](https://github.com/GuidoBartoli/sherloq).
The only thing I've added to the image is the straight lines connecting the "A" to "a" and "B" to "b"
# 1) 9619907
#Unsolved
# 2) A-a B-b cross
Drawing lines connecting the "A" to "a" and the "B" to "b" results in an X which marks the center of Namatama's yolk.
