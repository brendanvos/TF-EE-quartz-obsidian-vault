"Æ" as in "Mærsk" also appeared in [[CB2_Guns_and_Namas]].

The motto is used by many other organizations, and individuals, as well as in pop culture. Many of these uses have tenuous connections to the hunt ([source](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1207831938153578507/1207838895488639076)).
