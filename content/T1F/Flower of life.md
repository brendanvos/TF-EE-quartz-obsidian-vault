[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid "Overlapping circles grid")
> An **overlapping circles grid** is a geometric pattern of [repeating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation "Tessellation"), overlapping [circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") of an equal [radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius "Radius") in [two-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_space "Two-dimensional space"). Commonly, designs are based on circles centered on [triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_lattice "Triangular lattice") (with the simple, two circle form named _[vesica piscis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesica_piscis "Vesica piscis")_) or on the [square lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_lattice "Square lattice") pattern of points.

>Patterns of seven overlapping circles appear in historical artefacts from the 7th century BC onwards; they become a frequently used ornament in the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") period, and survive into medieval artistic traditions both in [Islamic art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_art "Islamic art") ([girih](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girih "Girih") decorations) and in [Gothic art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_art "Gothic art"). The name "Flower of Life" is given to the overlapping circles pattern in [New Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age "New Age") publications.

>Of special interest is the [six petal rosette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_petal_rosette "Six petal rosette") ([[Roses|Rose]]) derived from the "seven overlapping circles" pattern, also known as "[Sun of the Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_of_the_Alps "Sun of the Alps")" from its frequent use in alpine [folk art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_art "Folk art") in the 17th and 18th century.

#### Modern usage
> The name "Flower of Life" is modern, associated with the [New Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age "New Age") movement, and commonly attributed specifically to [Drunvalo Melchizedek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunvalo_Melchizedek "Drunvalo Melchizedek") in his book _The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life_ (1999).

>The pattern and modern name have propagated into wide range of usage in popular culture, in fashion, jewelry, tattoos and decorative products. The pattern in [quilting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilting "Quilting") has been called **[[Diamond]] wedding ring** or  #triangle wedding ring to contrast it from the [square pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid#Square_grid_of_overlapping_circles). Besides an occasional use in fashion, it is also used in the decorative arts. For example, the album _[Sempiternal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sempiternal_(album) "Sempiternal (album)")_ (2013) by [Bring Me the Horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_Me_the_Horizon "Bring Me the Horizon") uses the [61 overlapping circles grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid#Progressions) as the main feature of its album cover, whereas the album _[A Head Full of Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Head_Full_of_Dreams "A Head Full of Dreams")_ (2015) by [Coldplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldplay "Coldplay") features the 19 overlapping circles grid as the central part of its album cover. Teaser posters illustrating the cover art to _A Head Full of Dreams_ were widely displayed on the [London Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground "London Underground") in the last week of October 2015.

> The "[[The Sun|Sun]] of the Alps" ([Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") _Sole delle Alpi_) symbol has been used as the emblem of [Padanian nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padanian_nationalism "Padanian nationalism") in northern Italy since the 1990s. It resembles a pattern often found in that area on buildings
