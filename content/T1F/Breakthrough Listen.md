## Targets
> ...
> In October 2019 it was announced that Breakthrough Listen will collaborate with scientist from NASA's [Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite "Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite") (TESS) team. Over a thousand new planets found by TESS will be scanned for technosignatures. The search will use Listen's primary facilities (Green Bank and Parkes Telescopes, [[MeerKAT]], and the [Automated Planet Finder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Planet_Finder "Automated Planet Finder")) as well as partner facilities (including [VERITAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VERITAS "VERITAS"), [NenuFAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NenuFAR "NenuFAR"), [FAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-hundred-meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope"), the [Murchison Widefield Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murchison_Widefield_Array "Murchison Widefield Array"), [LOFAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-Frequency_Array_(LOFAR) "Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR)") stations in Ireland and Sweden, [Jodrell Bank Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodrell_Bank_Observatory "Jodrell Bank Observatory"), [e-MERLIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MERLIN "MERLIN"), [Keck Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._M._Keck_Observatory "W. M. Keck Observatory"), [Sardinia Radio Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia_Radio_Telescope "Sardinia Radio Telescope"), along with the [Allen Telescope Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Telescope_Array "Allen Telescope Array")). In addition to targeting of TESS planets with Listen facilities, the TESS lightcurves themselves will be searched for anomalies, for example caused by [megastructures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere "Dyson sphere").

## Results
> - In December 2017, Breakthrough Listen observed [ʻOumuamua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua "ʻOumuamua"), an [interstellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_object "Interstellar object") #asteroid with an unusually elongated shape, for any signs of radio emissions. Over eight hours of observing over a range of frequencies from 1.1–11.6 GHz, no emissions were detected.
>- In December 2018, a search for laser light emissions from [Boyajian's Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIC_8462852 "KIC 8462852") was carried out using the Automated Planet Finder, which is sensitive enough to detect a 24 MW laser at this distance. Although a number of candidates were identified, further analysis showed that they are coming from the Earth and not from the star.
>- In January 2020, a preliminary results for the nearby (<150 parsecs away) stars were announced, with no positive detections of artificial transmitters comparable to the terrestrial [Arecibo Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory "Arecibo Observatory") in the 3.95-8.00 GHz band. Also, it was concluded that at least 8% of 252 nearby stars in a zone allowing [detection of Earth by occultation method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_star#Planetary_transits "Variable star") ([[Occultation]]) do not have the [100%-duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_cycle "Duty cycle") (artificial) transmitters of the sort sought by the survey.
>- In December 2020, it was reported that in April and May 2019, a narrowband signal at 982.002 MHz was intercepted that showed shifts in its frequency consistent with the movement of a planet. No #modulation was detected. The signal appears to have originated from the direction of [[Proxima Centauri]]. It has been given the name Breakthrough Listen Candidate 1 ([BLC1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLC1 "BLC1")). As of December, the researchers were still working to rule out terrestrial interference, which they considered the most likely cause. One researcher called it "on par" with the [[Wow! signal]].
