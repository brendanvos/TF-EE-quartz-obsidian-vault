> **Mars** is the fourth [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") and the furthest [terrestrial planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planet "Terrestrial planet") from the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"). The [reddish color of its surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_surface_color "Mars surface color") is due to finely grained [iron(III) oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III)_oxide "Iron(III) oxide") ( #III) dust in the soil, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet". Mars’s radius is second smallest among the planets in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") at 3,389.5 km (2,106 mi). It has a surface [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") of 3.72 m/s (12.2 ft/s), which is 38% of Earth's gravity. The [Martian dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_dichotomy "Martian dichotomy") is visible on the surface: on average, the terrain on Mars’s northern hemisphere is flatter and lower than its southern hemisphere. Mars has [a thin atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Mars "Atmosphere of Mars") made primarily of [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide") and two irregularly shaped [natural satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite "Natural satellite"): [Phobos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon) "Phobos (moon)") and [Deimos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deimos_(moon) "Deimos (moon)").

> Mars is named after the [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome") [god of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_(mythology) "Mars (mythology)"). This association between Mars and war dates back at least to [[Babylonian astronomy]], in which the planet was named for the god [Nergal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nergal "Nergal"), deity of war and destruction. It persisted into modern times, as exemplified by [Gustav Holst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Holst "Gustav Holst")'s orchestral suite _[The Planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planets "The Planets")_, whose famous first movement labels Mars "the bringer of war". [The planet's symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_symbol "Gender symbol"), a circle with a spear pointing out to the upper right, is also used as a symbol for the male gender. The symbol dates from at latest the 11th century, though a possible predecessor has been found in the Greek [Oxyrhynchus Papyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyrhynchus_Papyri "Oxyrhynchus Papyri").

> The idea that Mars was populated by intelligent [Martians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian "Martian") became widespread in the late 19th century. [Schiaparelli's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Schiaparelli "Giovanni Schiaparelli") "canali" observations combined with [[Percival Lowell]]'s books on the subject put forward the standard notion of a planet that was a drying, cooling, dying world with ancient civilizations constructing irrigation works. Many other observations and proclamations by notable personalities added to what has been termed "Mars Fever". High-resolution mapping of the surface of Mars revealed no artifacts of habitation, but pseudoscientific speculation about intelligent life on Mars still continues. Reminiscent of the _canali_ observations, these speculations are based on small scale features perceived in the spacecraft images, such as "[[Pyramids]]" and the "[Face on Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydonia_(Mars) "Cydonia (Mars)")". In his book _[Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos_(Sagan_book) "Cosmos (Sagan book)"),_ planetary astronomer [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan "Carl Sagan") wrote: "Mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto which we have projected our Earthly hopes and fears."
