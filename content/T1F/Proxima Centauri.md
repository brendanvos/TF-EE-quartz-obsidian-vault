> **Proxima Centauri** is a small, low-mass [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") located [[4.2465]] [light-years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year") (1.3020 [pc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec "Parsec")) away from the #Sun in the southern [constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation "Constellation") of [[Centaurus]]. Its #Latin name means the 'nearest [[Star]] of Centaurus'. It was discovered in 1915 by [Robert Innes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_T._A._Innes "Robert T. A. Innes") and is the [nearest-known star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars_and_brown_dwarfs "List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs") to the Sun. With a quiescent [apparent magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude "Apparent magnitude") of 11.13, it is too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. Proxima Centauri is a member of the [[Alpha Centauri]] [star system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system "Star system"), being identified as component **Alpha Centauri C**, and is 2.18° to the southwest of the Alpha Centauri AB pair. It is currently 12,950 [[Au]] (0.2 [ly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year")) from #AB , which it orbits with a [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period") of about 550,000 years.

> Proxima Centauri is a [red dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf "Red dwarf") star with a mass about 12.5% of the Sun's mass ([M☉](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_mass "Solar mass")), and average [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density") about 33 times that of the Sun. Because of Proxima Centauri's proximity to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), its [angular diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter "Angular diameter") can be measured directly. Its actual diameter is about one-seventh (14%) the diameter of the Sun. Although it has a very low average [luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity "Luminosity"), Proxima Centauri is a [flare star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare_star "Flare star") that randomly undergoes dramatic increases in brightness because of [magnetic activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_activity "Magnetic activity"). The star's [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") is created by [convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection "Convection") throughout the stellar body, and the resulting flare activity generates a total [X-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray") emission similar to that produced by the Sun. The internal mixing of its fuel by convection through its core, and Proxima's relatively low energy-production rate, mean that it will be a [main-sequence star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main-sequence_star "Main-sequence star") for another four trillion years.

> Proxima Centauri has two known [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet "Exoplanet") and one candidate exoplanet: [Proxima Centauri b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b "Proxima Centauri b"), [Proxima Centauri d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_d "Proxima Centauri d") and the disputed [Proxima Centauri c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_c "Proxima Centauri c"). Proxima Centauri b orbits the star at a distance of roughly 0.05 AU (7.5 million km) with an orbital period of approximately 11.2 Earth days. Its estimated mass is at least 1.07 times that of Earth. Proxima b orbits within Proxima Centauri's [habitable zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitable_zone "Habitable zone")—the range where temperatures are right for liquid water to exist on its surface—but, because Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf and a flare star, the planet's [habitability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitability_of_red_dwarf_systems "Habitability of red dwarf systems") is highly uncertain. A candidate [super-Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-Earth "Super-Earth"), [Proxima Centauri c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_c "Proxima Centauri c"), orbits roughly 1.5 AU (220 million km) away every 1,900 d (5.2 yr). A [sub-Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Earth "Sub-Earth"), [Proxima Centauri d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_d "Proxima Centauri d"), orbits roughly 0.029 AU (4.3 million km) away every 5.1 days.
