### In alchemy and psychology
>The German mystical alchemist [Heinrich Khunrath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Khunrath "Heinrich Khunrath") wrote of the shape-changing sea-god who, because of his relationship to the sea, is both a symbol of the unconscious as well as the perfection of the art. Alluding to the _scintilla_, the spark from ‘the light of nature’ and symbol of the [[anima mundi]], Khunrath in Gnostic vein stated of the Protean element Mercury:

> "our Catholick Mercury, by virtue of his universal fiery spark of the light of nature, is beyond doubt Proteus, the sea god of the ancient pagan sages, who hath the key to the sea and …power over all things."

> In modern times, the Swiss psychologist [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung "Carl Jung") defined the mythological figure of Proteus as a personification of the unconscious, who, because of his gift of prophecy and shape-changing, has much in common with the central but elusive figure of alchemy, [Mercurius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(mythology) "Mercury (mythology)").

### In literature
>The poet [John Milton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton "John Milton"), aware of the association of Proteus with the Hermetic art of [alchemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy"), wrote in _[Paradise Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost "Paradise Lost")_ of alchemists who sought the [[Philosopher's stone]]:

> In vain, though by their powerful Art they bind  
> Volatile [Hermes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes "Hermes"), and call up unbound  
> In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea,  
> Drain'd through a [Limbec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alembic "Alembic") to his native form.
