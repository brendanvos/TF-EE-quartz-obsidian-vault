### 1995–1999: Formation
> Keenan (formerly of folk duo Hayward Winters) and Cargill met in the mid 1990s at the Sensateria psychedelic club, and formed Pan Am Flight Bag in 1995, renamed Broadcast after several concerts.

> The band's first release in 1996, was the 7" single "Accidentals" (issued on Wurlitzer Jukebox Records), which was written based around a [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music) "Sampling (music)") from [Joseph Losey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Losey "Joseph Losey")’s 1967 film _[Accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_(1967_film) "Accident (1967 film)")_. The same year, they released _The Book Lovers_ ( #love ) EP (issued in November by [Duophonic Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duophonic_Records "Duophonic Records")). In 1996, the band recorded a Peel Session.

> [Warp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_(record_label) "Warp (record label)") released a compilation album, _[Work and Non Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_and_Non_Work_(album) "Work and Non Work (album)")_, in June 1997, compiling the EP and two singles. The 1999 Broadcast track "You Can Fall" was included on the soundtrack album for the film _[Morvern Callar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morvern_Callar_(film) "Morvern Callar (film)")_, released by Warp in 2002.

> Cargill formed the project Children of Alice with House and former Broadcast member Stevens; they released their eponymous debut album in February 2017. The group's name is a tribute to Keenan, who had cited _[[Alice in Wonderland]]_ as a main inspiration.

### Equipment
> The band's recording gear and methods were profiled in a 2003 article in _[Electronic Musician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Musician "Electronic Musician")_, in which it was noted that they recorded many of their guitar arrangements (played at that time on a 1960s Italian [Eko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eko_guitars "Eko guitars") Edsel) through microphones, rather than through a [DI unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DI_unit "DI unit"). Additional instruments, including the [vibraphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibraphone "Vibraphone"), [timpani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timpani "Timpani"), clarinets and organ were recorded and subsequently fed through a speaker again in order to be re-recorded with microphones. Their private studio setup included an [[AKG]] BX-15, a [Fostex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fostex "Fostex") rackmount coil reverb amplifier and an Acutronics tray (originally sourced from a [Fender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Musical_Instruments_Corporation "Fender Musical Instruments Corporation") amplifier.) Their recording setup also included a [MOTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_Unicorn "Mark of the Unicorn") 2408 hard-disk recording system, an [Apple Mac G4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_G4 "PowerPC G4"), a [Fender Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Rhodes "Fender Rhodes"), a [Vox Continental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_Continental "Vox Continental") and a [Korg MS-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korg_MS-20 "Korg MS-20").

For digital production, the band sometimes used an reFX QuadraSid emulator and [Native Instruments Reaktor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaktor "Reaktor"). Commenting on the production of their third album, _Haha Sound_, Keenan said: "You know when it feels overworked. We used more of a minimalist approach on this album: There has been less emphasis on decoration and more on repetitive parts that go through the tracks. They are not the focus for your ear, but they are the foundation."
