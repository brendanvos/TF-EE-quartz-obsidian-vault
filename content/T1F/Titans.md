> In [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology"), the **Titans** ([Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): οἱ Τῑτᾶνες, _hoi Tītânes_, [singular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number "Grammatical number"): ὁ Τῑτᾱ́ν, -ήν, _ho Tītân_) were the pre-Olympian gods. According to the _[Theogony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theogony "Theogony")_ of [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod"), they were the twelve children of the primordial parents [Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus_(mythology) "Uranus (mythology)") (Sky) and [Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia "Gaia") (Earth), with six male Titans—[Oceanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanus "Oceanus"), [Coeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeus "Coeus"), [Crius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crius "Crius"), [Hyperion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(Titan) "Hyperion (Titan)"), [Iapetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus "Iapetus"), and [Cronus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronus "Cronus")—and six female Titans, called the **Titanides** or "Titanesses" (αἱ Τῑτᾱνῐ́δες, _hai Tītānídes_)—[Theia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia "Theia"), [Rhea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_(mythology) "Rhea (mythology)"), [Themis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themis "Themis"), [Mnemosyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemosyne "Mnemosyne"), [Phoebe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_(Titaness) "Phoebe (Titaness)"), and [Tethys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_(mythology) "Tethys (mythology)"). Cronus mated with his older sister Rhea, who then bore the first generation of Olympians: the six siblings [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus "Zeus"), [Hades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades "Hades"), [Poseidon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poseidon "Poseidon"), [Hestia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hestia "Hestia"), [Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter "Demeter"), and [Hera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera "Hera"). Certain descendants of the Titans, such as [Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus "Prometheus"), [Atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology) "Atlas (mythology)"), [Helios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios "Helios"), and [Leto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leto "Leto"), are sometimes also called Titans.

> The Titans were the former gods: the generation of gods preceding the [Olympians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Olympians#Olympians "Twelve Olympians"). They were overthrown as part of the Greek succession myth, which tells how Cronus seized power from his father Uranus and ruled the cosmos with his fellow Titans before being in turn defeated and replaced as the ruling pantheon of gods by Zeus and the Olympians in a ten-year war called "the [Titanomachy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanomachy "Titanomachy")" (ἡ Τῑτᾱνομᾰχῐ́ᾱ Τῑτᾱνομαχίᾱ _hē Tītānomakhíā_). As a result of this war, the vanquished Titans were banished from the upper world and held imprisoned under guard in [Tartarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus "Tartarus"), although apparently some Titans were allowed to remain free.
