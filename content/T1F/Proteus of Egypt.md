>Proteus was generally regarded as the son of the sea-god Poseidon and [Phoenice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenice_(mythology) "Phoenice (mythology)"), a daughter of King [[Phoenix (son of Agenor)|Phoenix]] of [Phoenicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia "Phoenicia").

>The children of Proteus by [Torone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torone_(mythology) "Torone (mythology)") ([Chrysone](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chrysone&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chrysone (page does not exist)")) of [Phlegra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlegra_(mythology) "Phlegra (mythology)") were [Polygonus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonus_(mythology) "Polygonus (mythology)") ([Tmolus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmolus_(father_of_Tantalus) "Tmolus (father of Tantalus)")) and [Telegonus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegonus "Telegonus"). They both challenged [Heracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles "Heracles") at the behest of [Hera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera "Hera") and were killed by the hero. Another son of Proteus, [Eioneus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eioneus "Eioneus"), became the father of [Dymas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymas_of_Phrygia "Dymas of Phrygia"), king of [Phrygia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygia "Phrygia"). By the [Nereid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nereid "Nereid") [Psamathe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psamathe_(Nereid) "Psamathe (Nereid)"), Proteus fathered [Theoclymenos](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theoclymenus_of_Egypt&action=edit&redlink=1 "Theoclymenus of Egypt (page does not exist)") and [Theonoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theonoe_of_Egypt "Theonoe of Egypt") ([Eidothea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidothea_(Greek_myth) "Eidothea (Greek myth)") or [Eurynome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurynome "Eurynome")). [Cabeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabeiro "Cabeiro"), mother of the [Cabeiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabeiri "Cabeiri") and the three Cabeirian [nymphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymph "Nymph") by [Hephaestus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestus "Hephaestus"), was also called the daughter of Proteus. Other daughters were [Rhoiteia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoeteia "Rhoeteia") who gave her name to the city of [Rhoiteion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoiteion "Rhoiteion") in [Troad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troad "Troad"), [Thebe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebe_(Greek_myth) "Thebe (Greek myth)") who became the eponym of [Thebes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebes,_Egypt "Thebes, Egypt") in Egypt and [Thaicrucia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaicrucia "Thaicrucia") who mothered [Nympheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nympheus "Nympheus") by [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus "Zeus").

>According to [Virgil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil "Virgil") in the fourth [Georgic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgics "Georgics"), at one time the bees of [Aristaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristaeus "Aristaeus"), son of [[Apollo (Greek+Roman God)|Apollo]], all died of a disease. Aristaeus went to his mother, [Cyrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrene_(mythology) "Cyrene (mythology)"), for help; she told him that Proteus could tell him how to prevent another such disaster, but would do so only if compelled. Aristaeus had to seize Proteus and hold him, no matter what he would change into. Aristaeus did so, and Proteus eventually gave up and told him that the bees' death was a punishment for causing the death of [Eurydice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurydice "Eurydice"). To make amends, Aristaeus needed to sacrifice 12 ( #Num12) animals to the gods, leave the carcasses in the place of sacrifice, and return three days later. He followed these instructions, and upon returning, he found in one of the carcasses a swarm of bees which he took to his [apiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apiary "Apiary"). The bees were never again troubled by disease.
