> Currently Belgian company [Hyperion Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Entertainment "Hyperion Entertainment") ([[Hyperion]]) maintains and develops [AmigaOS 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmigaOS_4 "AmigaOS 4"), which is an official and direct descendant of [[AmigaOS]] 3.1 – the last system made by Commodore for the original Amiga Computers.

## Hardware
>The Amiga has a custom chipset consisting of several [coprocessors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprocessor "Coprocessor") which handle audio, video, and [direct memory access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access "Direct memory access") independently of the [Central Processing Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit") (CPU). This architecture gave the Amiga a performance edge over its competitors, particularly for graphics-intensive applications and games.

>The architecture uses two distinct [bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing) "Bus (computing)") subsystems: the chipset bus and the CPU bus. The chipset bus allows the coprocessors and CPU to address ["Chip RAM"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Chip_RAM "Amiga Chip RAM"). The CPU bus provides addressing to conventional RAM, ROM and the [Zorro II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Zorro_II "Amiga Zorro II") or [Zorro III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Zorro_III "Amiga Zorro III")( #III) expansion subsystems. This enables independent operation of the subsystems. The CPU bus can be much faster than the chipset bus. CPU expansion boards may provide additional custom buses. Additionally, "busboards" or "bridgeboards" may provide [ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Standard_Architecture "Industry Standard Architecture") or [PCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_PCI "Conventional PCI") buses.

### Other peripherals and expansions
> In the North American market, the _NewTek [Video Toaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Toaster "Video Toaster")_ was a video effects board that turned the Amiga into an affordable video processing computer that found its way into many professional video environments. One well-known use was to create the special effects in early series of _[[Babylon 5]]_.

#### Networking
>Amiga has three networking interface APIs:
>- AS225: the official Commodore TCP/IP stack [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface") with hard-coded drivers in revision 1 (AS225r1) for the [A2065 Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Lance_Am7990 "AMD Lance Am7990") and the A2060 Arcnet ( [[Arc Raiders]] ?) interfaces. In revision 2, (AS225r2) the SANA-II interface was used.

## Marketing
> The first official Amiga logo was a [[rainbow]]-colored double [check mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_mark "Check mark"). In later marketing material Commodore largely dropped the checkmark and used logos styled with various typefaces.

### Special purpose applications
> - Amigas were used in various [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") laboratories to keep track of low orbiting #satellite s until 2004. Amigas were used at Kennedy Space Center to run strip-chart recorders, to format and display data, and control stations of platforms for [Delta rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_(rocket_family) "Delta (rocket family)") launches.
> - [Palomar Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palomar_Observatory "Palomar Observatory") used Amigas to calibrate and control the [charge-coupled devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device "Charge-coupled device") in their [[telescope]]s, as well as to display and store the digitized images they collected.
