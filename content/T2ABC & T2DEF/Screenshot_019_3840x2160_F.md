# 1) Guitar Chord
#Unsolved
This depicts an [Em/G chord](https://www.scales-chords.com/chord/guitar/Em%5CG). The [[Whiteboard G6 Chord]] was used to come to the conclusion that a '6' could replace the letter 'G'. We do not yet have a solid explanation for this chord, which is identical to the G6 chord except the fourth string is changed from a D to an E.
