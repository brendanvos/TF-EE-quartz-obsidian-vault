The channel in the discord that had the original video no longer exists and now appears as [<label>#</label>No Access](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1009830216023150775/1172588978029990029)
The video was also [uploaded to Twitter](https://twitter.com/reachthefinals/status/1723029471391850775), although this version is much smaller and compressed.
Community Manager Justice has [reuploaded the video](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1201288968562552863/1210285974295412746) in what is presumed to be the original Discord quality.
