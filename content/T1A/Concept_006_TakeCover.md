Here are the known clues which are immediately apparent in the image:
![[TakeCover_apparent_clues.png | 2000]]
# 1. αίθουσα
There are three groupings of characters hidden near the bottom of the image (above the footer). These were found in three separate posts ([1c](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1027948287904460851), [1a](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1028027996969369670), [1b](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1028029333253664919))

These characters were determined to be approximately "ai0ouoa" in [this post](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1028317097350148167). 

They were then pinpointed to be αίθουσα in [this post](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1028327159749689384) and [this post](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1028330278369886368) .
αίθουσα was then connected to [[Aethusa]] in [this post](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1028689483052355794).

# 2.  [[Aethusa cynapium]]

In [this message](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1029659270821724160) (image of message: [[Missed_Clues_T1A.png]]) Rob pointed out a connection which was never made regarding a Aethusa plant hidden in the image.
> On the second image, there was two prominent flowers that are not visible in the trailer present. The flower is called [[Aethusa cynapium]] (Fools parsley). This is a dangerous flower and the latin name is derived from the Arab word 'ai' what means burning, since the plant gives you burning pains.

# 3. Poseidon Trident Symbol
Poseidon is the father of [[Aethusa]]. 
I believe this is close to if not the exact image used:
