A single plainly visible clue [has been found](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1030569466481885274) in the image:

The text is more legible when adjustments are made to the image ([credit](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1030570013935009872)):

Replacing the letters in the text with numbers using conventional [leet/1337](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) conversions leaves you with the string "1908 01 18151A01". 

By grouping these digits into pairs and using them index to the n$^{th}$ letter of the alphabet (Using 1 based indexing where 1=A, and 26=Z) you get the name "Sharona": 
	19 - S
	08 - H
	01 - A
	18 - R
	15 - O
	14 - N
	01 - A

[The song *My Sharona*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Sharona) was released in the year 1979, directly pointing towards the T1B password. #num79 

# Piano Sonata No.25, Op.79
In the footer of the image some hidden dots [were found](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1030576860943372379.). In photoshop I've had the best results using a levels adjustment layer and setting the shadow input level to 22, the highlights level to 52, and lowering the midtone level, resulting in the following:

The dots [were then isolated](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1030682545274228746).

Repeated attempts at transcription were made, none of which produced fruitful audio.

Upon finding [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s signature in [[OSPUZE_Candiii]] an image which matched the music notes [was found](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1035914050883829790) on [the Wikipedia page for his piece Piano Sonata No.25, Op.79](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._25_(Beethoven))

> Hey all! Just to cut time, we wanted to meter your expectations and let you know that you still have a ways to go on the current clues. If your efforts fall flat, we can try to get a new clue out of Rob. It is his forte, after all!

After solving the clue another clue from [[OSPUZE_Candiii]] was deciphered to be SONATA - XXV
