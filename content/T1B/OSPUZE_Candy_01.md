Replacing the letters in the text with numbers using conventional [leet/1337](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) conversions leaves you with the string "1908 01 18151A01". 

By grouping these digits into pairs and using them index to the n$^{th}$ letter of the alphabet (Using 1 based indexing where 1=A, and 26=Z) you get the name "Sharona": 
	19 - S
	08 - H
	01 - A
	18 - R
	15 - O
	14 - N
	01 - A
