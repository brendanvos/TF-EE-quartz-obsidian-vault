An identical copy of the image was [posted](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1031539174743998526/1034504554085097583) to the brand new <label>#</label>official-art the next day:

# 0) Cand*iii*
The title of the image is a clue itself. This is the third "candy" image provided, and iii represents 3 in Roman numerals. It is possible that this was also alluding to the password cacoiii in T1E.

# 1) 43 34 33 11 44 11 - XXV
Converting the numbers using tap code and the roman numerals gives the string "SONATA - 25". This is the same clue as in [[Extra_Ospuze_Candy]], only this time the pieces have been lined up and put in the correct order.

# 2) 1908 01 18 15 1401
Splitting the digits into groups of two, then using them to index into the alphabet (starting at one) gives the string "SHARONA"

The song [My Sharona by The Knack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Sharona) was released in 1979

# 3) Alt57, tally marks
An [alt code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_code) for the character "9" is followed by 7 represented by [tally marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_marks). This again points to the number 79.

# 4) Rivet counts
On the front of the bullet feed pouch there are 7 rivets, and on the side there are 9. This again points to the number 79. 

# 5) Beethoven signature
More of Beethoven's signature can be found hidden in the footer of the image. The signature is not visible without adjusting the image. In photoshop I've had the best results using a levels adjustment layer and setting the shadow input level to 11, the highlights level to 38, and boosting the midtone input level to 0.25.
