## 1) 43 34 33 44 11-XXV
Snippets of numeric text were found throughout the image ([1e](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1033144605178335292), [1c](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1033148848010448936), [1a](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1033149124096299039), [1d](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1033149188365635616), [1b](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1033150066317344819)). The string is completed by arranging the snippets which contain purely [Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals) from their placement in the image left to right and placing the snippet with [[Roman Numerals]] at the end. 

Using [tap code (aka knock code)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_code) to decode the Arabic numerals, and replacing the Roman numerals with their Arabic equivalent results in the solved string "SONATA - 25" 

## 2) Ludwig signature snippet
This is [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s first name from his signature:
![LVB signature | 1000](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Beethoven_Signature.svg/2560px-Beethoven_Signature.svg.png)
The identity of the signature was not discovered until a second snipet of the signature was found when [[Ospuze_Candiii]] was released.
## 3) Two tick marks
#Unsolved
