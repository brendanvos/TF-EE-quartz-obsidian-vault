# Pigpen cipher

With some light photo editing a hidden pigpen cipher was found in the image ([credit](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1029453835057496084)). 
The cipher can be found using many techniques; here I've shown how it can be found by adjusting curves in the photo (it's faint, but it's there): ![[OSPUZE_pigpen.png | 1300]]
The characters for the cipher [were quickly identified](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1029457222369030185). Here I've isolated only the cipher:

[The Wiki page for the pigpen cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigpen_cipher) has an image which explains everything you need to know to solve this cipher:
![pig_pen_cipher](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Pigpen_cipher_key.svg/1280px-Pigpen_cipher_key.svg.png)
Start with the left most character of the cipher which looks like a blocky capital C. See how the grid outline around the letter "F" in the Wikipedia image match that part of the cipher? That's all there is to it!
For cipher characters that have double lines use the upper right key from the wiki page. Instead of using dots Rob's pigpen cipher uses double lines! Do this for the whole cipher and you'll quickly get the answer:
### FKRAMER
[This was quickly found](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1029674085816479777) to be a reference to Frank Kramer, the credited name of director [[Gianfranco Parolini]].

# The below clues are all apparent in the unedited image. Use this image as reference for locating them: ![[OSPUZE_apparent_clues.png | 1300]]
# 1. mmisar X
Around the same time [[Gianfranco Parolini]] was mentioned the text "mmisar X" was found on the [M60](https://www.thefinals.wiki/wiki/M60). The beginning of the text was occluded by the bullet feed, however the recently solved pigpen clue pointing Frank Kramer helped [immediately discover](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1029673983156690984) that this textm was referring to a film he directed named [[Kommissar X]].

# 2. 1962 #num1962
Several of the bullets feeding into the  and falling out of its feed bag have grey dots in the center of the primer on the base of the casing. ([credit](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1030107164259405844))

By counting the contiguous sequences of bullets with grey dots you get the number 1962. ([credit](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1030164123889176689))

This was [immediately linked](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1030164529725837312) to the films [[Gianfranco Parolini]] released in 1962, including [[79 A.D.]] 

# 3. X
On the Ospuze sheriff badge strapped to the forestock of the M60 there is a letter "X". The presence of the "X" led hunters to consider it as a [[Roman Numerals|Roman Numeral]] 10, potentially connecting to [[Gianfranco Parolini]]'s film *The Ten Gladiators*

# 4. 832 #num832
The presence of 8 bullets strapped to the [M11](https://www.thefinals.wiki/wiki/M11) alongside the number "32" stamped into the gun pointed toward "Ab urbe condita 832" - a representation of the year AD 79 in a different calendar system. 
Looking at the [AD 79 Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AD_79) the roman numeral password is present between AD 79 and Ab urb condita 832.  ![832](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1011929497139953744/1038421217050382336/image.png)
