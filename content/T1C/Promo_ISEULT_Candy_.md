Upon completing T1B hunters were rewarded with the newest image. A much higher resolution version was then uploaded to the \#official-art channel [here](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1031539174743998526/1036205427588857946):

# 1) AA - Anders Ångström
There are two lone "A" characters in the image. The first is located on the rear sight tower of the [AKM](https://www.thefinals.wiki/wiki/AKM) (above the foregrip), while the second is on the buttstock of the [M60](https://www.thefinals.wiki/wiki/M60). 
It is believed that these A's are referring to the first letter of the first and last name of Anders Jonas Ångström, a founder of the science of spectroscopy.
[Spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy) is useful in analytical chemistry because atoms and molecules have unique properties which allow them to be distinguished in a sample using various instruments.

This clue was guiding us to think about **atoms**.

# 2) E-2a / Луна III
> [Luna 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_3), or E-2A No.1 (Russian: Луна 3), was a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1959 as part of the Luna programme. 

The Soviet origins of the spacecraft and the use of Cyrillic both serve to guide us toward a Soviet connection.

The substitution of Roman numerals for the 3 in the Russian name allude to the regular themes of Roman numeral replacement and "three" which seem to be ubiquitous throughout the hunt, despite not being used in this tier's password.  
# 3) Pink equilateral triangle
Pink Floyd's dark side of the moon

The ***pink*** equilateral triangle was interpreted as a nod to ***Pink*** Floyd's album [Dark Side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon), as the album cover features an equilateral triangle. The name of the album serves as another nod to Luna 3, while the album cover is a nod to spectroscopy because of the light refraction and dispersion.

# 4) 118
There are 118 known elements.

# 5) AAИ
These characters are [Cyrillic Numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_numerals), equivalent to the number 118. 
This again points to the known elements, but also points to a Soviet connection due to the Cyrillic. 

# 6) "..-." -> F
"..-." represents the letter F. 
Mendelevium is present in the [F block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(periodic_table)#f-block) of the periodic table.

# 7) X<sup>-X</sup>
The magazine is upside down, so the apparent "<sub>x</sub>-X" is actually reversed. X is 10 in Roman numerals, so this clue can be interpreted as 10<sup>-10</sup>. 

The angstrom unit is 10<sup>-10</sup>m.

# 8) 460BC
Ancient Greek philosopher [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus) was born in 460BC. 
> primarily remembered today for his formulation of an [atomic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism") of the universe.

This is another clue directing us to focus on atoms.
