# 1) A
Angstrom

# 2) 2.75 3.26
Violet light has photon energy of 2.75–3.26 [eV](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt "Electronvolt")

# 3) 29.9N 41.6W
These are the coordinates of the [Angström crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angstr%C3%B6m_(crater)) on the moon.
The characters "N" and "W" are a violet color.

# 4) Αβδηρος
This is Ancient Greek for the hero [Abderus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abderus). The city [Abdera, Thrace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdera,_Thrace "Abdera, Thrace") is named after him. Abdera is the birthplace of Democritus. Thus this clue also points us towards atoms.

# 5) 1869 ([Cistercian numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercian_numerals))
![[Cistercian_1869.png]]
> The first periodic table to become generally accepted was that of the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869

# 6) Light refraction/dispersion
The acrylic in the lower right is shown acting as a prism, refracting and dispersing light into its component parts.
This is believed to be another clue towards spectroscopy.

# 7) Spectra
#Unsolved 
There are two spots in the image which appear to depict spectra, possibly from atomic spectroscopy. 
This again points towards spectroscopy as a clue, however it is likely more unsolved information is hidden in these clues. 
We have not yet determined what is depicted in the spectra.
