![[Whiteboard_G6_Composite.png]]
This is a composite image which has the left half of the chord taken from the whiteboard found in Dragon Constellation Studio and the right half from the whiteboard found in the hospital.
The white middle portion has been filled in using context from the whiteboard images. 

The the image depicts a G6 chord as played on a typical six-string guitar in [standard tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_tuning#Guitar_family).
It is notable that the fourth string ([wiki: how strings are numbered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Stringed_instrument_tunings#Numbering_of_strings)) is not visible on the whiteboards, as a clue in [[Screenshot_019_3840x2160_F]] depicts a Em/G chord, which is identical to the G6 chord except the fourth string is changed from a D to an E.

G6 was used as a letter substitution in solving [[T2ABC & T2DEF/index|index]]
