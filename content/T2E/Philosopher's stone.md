 > The **philosopher's stone**, or more properly **philosophers' stone** ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): حجر الفلاسفة, [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic "Romanization of Arabic"): _ḥajar al-falāsifa_; [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _[[Stone|Lapis]] philosophorum_), is a mythic [alchemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy") substance capable of turning [base metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_metal "Base metal") such as [[Mercury (element)]] into [[Gold]] (_[chrysopoeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysopoeia "Chrysopoeia")_, from the Greek χρυσός _khrusos_, "gold", and ποιεῖν _poiēin_, "to make") or silver. It is also called the [elixir of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_of_life "Elixir of life"), useful for [rejuvenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejuvenation "Rejuvenation") and for achieving [immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality "Immortality"); for many centuries, it was the most sought-after goal in [[Alchemy]]. The philosopher's stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, [enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(spiritual) "Enlightenment (spiritual)"), and heavenly bliss. Efforts to discover the philosopher's stone were known as the [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|Magnum opus]] ("Great Work").
 
### Names
>Numerous synonyms were used to make oblique reference to the stone, such as "white stone" (_calculus albus_, identified with the _calculus candidus_ of Revelation 2:17 which was taken as a symbol of the glory of heaven), _[vitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitriol "Vitriol")_ (as expressed in the [backronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym "Backronym") _Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem_) #Occult, also _lapis noster_, _lapis occultus_, _in water at the box_, and numerous oblique, mystical or mythological references such as _[Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam "Adam"), Aer, Animal, Alkahest, Antidotus, [Antimonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony "Antimony"), Aqua benedicta, Aqua volans per aeram, [Arcanum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/arcanum "wikt:arcanum"), Atramentum, Autumnus, Basilicus, Brutorum cor, Bufo, Capillus, Capistrum auri, Carbones, [Cerberus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus "Cerberus"), [[Chaos]], Cinis cineris, [Crocus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocus "Crocus"), Dominus philosophorum, Divine quintessence, Draco elixir, Filius ignis, Fimus, Folium, Frater, Granum, Granum frumenti, Haematites, Hepar, Herba, Herbalis, Lac, Melancholia, Ovum philosophorum, Panacea salutifera, [Pandora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora "Pandora"), [[Phoenix]], Philosophic [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]], Pyrites, Radices arboris solares, Regina, #Rex regum, Sal metallorum, Salvator terrenus, Talcum, Thesaurus, Ventus hermetis_. Many of the medieval allegories for a Christ were adopted for the _lapis_, and the Christ and the Stone were indeed taken as identical in a mystical sense. The name of "Stone" or _lapis_ itself is informed by early Christian allegory, such as [Priscillian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priscillian "Priscillian") (4th century), who stated,
>"_Unicornis est Deus, nobis petra Christus, nobis lapis angularis Jesus, nobis hominum homo Christus_ (One-horned is God, Christ the rock to us, Jesus the cornerstone to us, Christ the man of men to us.)"

## Creation
> The philosopher's stone is created by the alchemical method known as The Magnum Opus or The Great Work. Often expressed as a series of color changes or chemical processes, the instructions for creating the philosopher's stone are varied. When expressed in colors, the work may pass through phases of [nigredo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigredo "Nigredo"), [albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo_(alchemy) "Albedo (alchemy)"), [citrinitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrinitas "Citrinitas"), and [rubedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubedo "Rubedo"). When expressed as a series of chemical processes it often includes seven or twelve stages concluding in [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_(alchemy) "Multiplication (alchemy)"), and [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(alchemy) "Projection (alchemy)").
