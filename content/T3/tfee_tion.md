This image is completely greyscale, meaning each single pixel has identical red, green, and blue color values. Unlike [[tfee_ques]], this background is not homogenous. 
Using any signal separation algorithm in [[sherloq]] with a radius of 10 and equalized levels shows that the background appears to be comprised of overlapping PETSCII characters:
