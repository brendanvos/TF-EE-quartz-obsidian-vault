Welcome to my web of thoughts and research regarding THE FINALS Easter Egg Hunt. I joined in on the hunt during T2E, an thus the majority of *my* research begins there and works forward.

I have begun documenting past tiers, primarily using [Flex4d's TFEE document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CLzGtj2w2elVkqEdPV6NgqRiszNAxnwIANXHK-Pa1Bk)

T1A [[T1A/index|index]]
T1B [[T1B/index|index]]
T1C [[T1C/index|index]]

I haven't properly documented the tiers after this. My personal notes for later tiers are still in this vault. Expect them to be wild and unhinged.
