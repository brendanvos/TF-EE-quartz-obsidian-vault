> **Albertus Magnus** [OP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order "Dominican Order") (c. 1200 – 15 November 1280), also known as **Saint Albert the Great** or **Albert of Cologne**, was a German [Dominican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order "Dominican Order") [friar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friar "Friar"), philosopher, scientist, and [bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_in_the_Catholic_Church "Bishop in the Catholic Church"). Later [canonized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonization "Canonization") as a [Catholic saint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_saint "Catholic saint"), he was known during his lifetime as _Doctor universalis_ and _Doctor expertus_ and, late in his life, the [sobriquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobriquet "Sobriquet") _[Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_known_as_%22the_Great%22 "List of people known as "the Great"")_ was appended to his name. Scholars such as James A. Weisheipl and Joachim R. Söder have referred to him as the greatest German philosopher and theologian of the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"). The [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") distinguishes him as one of the 37 [Doctors of the Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_the_Church "Doctor of the Church").

>Albert's writings collected in 1899 went to thirty-eight volumes. These displayed his prolific habits and encyclopedic knowledge of topics such as [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology"), [botany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany "Botany"), [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography "Geography"), [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology "Astrology"), [mineralogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralogy "Mineralogy"), [[alchemy]], [zoology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology "Zoology"), [physiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology "Physiology"), [phrenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology "Phrenology"), [justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice "Justice"), [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law"), [friendship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship "Friendship"), and #love . He digested, interpreted, and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. Most modern knowledge of Aristotle was preserved and presented by Albert.

> Albert's knowledge of natural science was considerable and for the age remarkably accurate. His industry in every department was great: not only did he produce commentaries and paraphrases of the entire Aristotelian corpus, including his scientific works, but Albert also added to and improved upon them. His books on topics like botany, zoology, and minerals included information from ancient sources, but also results of his own empirical investigations. These investigations pushed several of the special sciences forward, beyond the reliance on classical texts. In the case of embryology, for example, it has been claimed that little of value was written between Aristotle and Albert, who managed to identify organs within eggs. Furthermore, Albert also effectively invented entire special sciences, where Aristotle has not covered a topic. For example, prior to Albert, there was no systematic study of minerals. For the breadth of these achievements, he was bestowed the name _Doctor Universalis._ #Universe  


### [[Alchemy]]
> In the centuries since his death, many stories arose about Albert as an [alchemist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy") and magician. "Much of the modern confusion results from the fact that later works, particularly the alchemical work known as the _Secreta Alberti_ or the _Experimenta Alberti_, were falsely attributed to Albertus by their authors to increase the prestige of the text through association." On the subject of alchemy and chemistry, many treatises relating to alchemy have been attributed to him, though in his authentic writings he had little to say on the subject, and then mostly through commentary on Aristotle. For example, in his commentary, _De mineralibus_, he refers to the power of [[stone]]s, but does not elaborate on what these powers might be. A wide range of Pseudo-Albertine works dealing with alchemy exist, though, showing the belief developed in the generations following Albert's death that he had mastered alchemy, one of the fundamental sciences of the Middle Ages. These include _Metals and Materials_; the _Secrets of Chemistry_; the _Origin of Metals_; the _Origins of Compounds_, and a _Concordance_ which is a collection of _Observations on the [[Philosopher's stone]]_; and other alchemy-chemistry topics, collected under the name of _Theatrum Chemicum_. He is credited with the discovery of the element [arsenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic "Arsenic") and experimented with photosensitive chemicals, including [silver nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_nitrate "Silver nitrate"). He did believe that stones had #occult properties, as he related in his work _De mineralibus_. However, there is scant evidence that he personally performed alchemical experiments.

> According to legend, Albert is said to have discovered the philosopher's stone and passed it on to his pupil Thomas Aquinas, shortly before his death. Albert does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of [[gold]] by "transmutation." Given that Thomas Aquinas died six years before Albert's death, this legend as stated is unlikely.

### Music
> Albert is known for his commentary on the musical practice of his times. Most of his written musical observations are found in his commentary on Aristotle's _Poetics_. He rejected the idea of "[music of the spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_universalis "Musica universalis")" as ridiculous: movement of astronomical bodies, he supposed, is incapable of generating sound. He wrote extensively on proportions in music, and on the three different subjective levels on which [plainchant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plainchant "Plainchant") could work on the human soul: purging of the impure; illumination leading to contemplation; and nourishing perfection through contemplation. Of particular interest to 20th-century music theorists is the attention he paid to silence as an integral part of music.

## Influence and tribute
> Due to his contributions to natural philosophy, the bacterium _Agrobacterium albertimagni_, the plant species _[Alberta magna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta_magna "Alberta magna")_ ( #aster id #flower) , the crustacean _Bodigiella albertimagni_, the fossil brachiopod _Albasphe albertimagni_, and the #asteroid [20006 Albertus Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20006_Albertus_Magnus "20006 Albertus Magnus") were named after him.
