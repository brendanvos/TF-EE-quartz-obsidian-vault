# 1) 'E' and 'e'
Perhaps pointing to `E -> 3 -> iii`
# 2) Missing keys 'C', 'A', 'O', '3'
Can be used to spell out CaCO3
# 3) Protoporphyrin IX

# 5) Underlined letters
#Unsolved
Multiple elements of the periodic table visibly have their first letter underlined. 
Notably the element Hs (Hassium) has its 'H' underlined, but it crossed out with a black marker. Rob reacted with a ðŸ¤” to [a message which noted this fact](https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1011929497139953744/1106262641657249894).
Excluding the 'H' from Hs leaves a set of letters which can spell out the word "MONARCHIES".

We presume this to be a photo of Rob based on the visible armband and baseball cap. He appears to be displaying the [ILY sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILY_sign) with one hand and the [shaka sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaka_sign) or the letter Y from [ASL's American Letter Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_manual_alphabet#Gallery) with the other.
His lower half appears to be merged with some partial concentric ovals, vaguely resembling the shape of an eye.
