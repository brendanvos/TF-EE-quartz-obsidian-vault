Interatomic forces graph pointing us to molecules.

# 4) Cross Cipher
#Unsolved 
Same as in [[Wallpaper_CB_Up_We_Go]], however harder to isolate.
Wondering *why* it would be identical yet harder to isolate in a later image I set about isolating it as best I could.
I found that taking bit planes 0-3 for all the channels, inverting the 0th and 3rd planes, and then merging them with a multiply blend mode resulted in a nearly perfect isolation.
Doing so also left Robatama looking like a starry night sky:

# 5) 512006 5 2 120013130A171100
Here the first 8 digits of the string represents the same as clue 2:
512006 5 2 
s/2006 s 2

The next digit "1" is also believed to represent a slash.

The next 7 digits are believed to represent a date.
### March 13, 2001.
The date was originally interpreted to be March 13, 2001. This lead to the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010313.html).
>**Explanation:** Have you ever seen a [sun pillar](http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/opt/ice/sp.rxml)? When the air is cold and the Sun is rising or [setting](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap980526.html), falling [ice crystals](http://samba.student.oulu.fi/~jarkkoko/REPLICA.HTM) can reflect sunlight and create an [unusual](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000507.html) column of light. Ice sometimes forms flat, stop-sign [shaped crystals](http://www.sundog.clara.co.uk/halo/crystals.htm) as it falls from high-level [clouds](http://www.met.tamu.edu/class/Metr304/Exer10dir/classification.html). [Air resistance](http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/bga.html) causes these crystals to lie nearly flat much of the time as they flutter to the ground. Sunlight reflects off crystals that are properly aligned, creating the [sun-pillar](http://www.sundog.clara.co.uk/halo/pillar.htm) effect. In the [above picture](http://geocities.com/stanzman_2001/), a [sun-pillar](http://www.meteoros.de/englisch/ee08e.htm) reflects light from a setting Sun.

This could be pointing toward ice, like other clues in the tier.

### March 31, 2001
Much later, after the tier was already solved I wondered if we could've mixed up the day and the month.
This led me to the day [Clifford Shull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Shull) died.
> Professor Shull's \[Nobel] prize was awarded for his pioneering work in [neutron scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_scattering "Neutron scattering"), a technique that reveals where atoms are within a material like ricocheting bullets reveal where obstacles are in the dark.

This could be pointing towards atoms, pointing us towards the chemical formula for CaCO3

# 6) 206888
This number was also seen in [[Wallpaper_CB_Up_We_Go]].

Calcium atomic number 20
Carbon atomic number 6
Oxygen atomic number 8
CaCO3.
