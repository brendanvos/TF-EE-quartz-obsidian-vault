# 4) Cross Cipher
#Unsolved 
Same as in [[Wallpaper_CB_Up_We_Go]], however harder to isolate.
Wondering *why* it would be identical yet harder to isolate in a later image I set about isolating it as best I could.
I found that taking bit planes 0-3 for all the channels, inverting the 0th and 3rd planes, and then merging them with a multiply blend mode resulted in a nearly perfect isolation.
Doing so also left Robatama looking like a starry night sky:

# 5) 512006 5 2 120013130A171100
#Unsolved (The relevance of Kari Mannerla to the hunt is speculated, but unknown)
### 512006 5 2: Kari
Here the first 8 digits of the string represents the same as clue 2:
512006 5 2 
s/2006 s 2
### 1200131304171100: Mannerla
Breaking up the string into two digit substrings and using A0Z25 to convert the numbers to letters gives the solution:

| 12 | 00 | 13 | 13 | 04 | 17 | 11 | 0 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| M | A | N | N | E | R | L | A |
### Kari Mannerla
Both Kari and Mannerla appeared as clues on their own, but this is the first location where they have been found combined.
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_Mannerla)
> **Kari Mannerla** (January 9, 1930, [Helsinki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki "Helsinki"), [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland "Finland") – July 12, 2006, Helsinki, Finland) was a Finnish [board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game "Board game") and [card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_game "Card game") designer and advertising agency executive. The most famous game designed by Mannerla is the board game _[Afrikan tähti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikan_t%C3%A4hti "Afrikan tähti")_ (_The Star of Africa_), the idea of which he began to develop in 1949. The game was published two years later. Mannerla made up the name of the game when reading an article about the biggest diamond in the world, the [Star of Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_Africa "Star of Africa"), discovered in [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa").

### The Star of Africa
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cullinan_Diamond)
 It had a blue-white hue and contained a small pocket of air, which at certain angles produced a rainbow, or [Newton's rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_rings "Newton's rings").

### Newton's Rings

This pattern closely resembles [the burrw diamond clue](https://www.reachthefinals.com/burrw) and artifacts found in many of the <label>#</label>official-art images.
