### Music
> The ecclesiastical forms of [[Byzantine Music]]—composed to Greek texts as ceremonial, festival, or church music—are today the most well-known forms. Ecclesiastical chants were a fundamental part of this genre. Greek and foreign historians agree that the ecclesiastical tones and in general the whole system of Byzantine music is closely related to the [ancient Greek system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_ancient_Greece "Music of ancient Greece"). It remains the oldest genre of extant music, of which the manner of performance and (with increasing accuracy from the 5th century onwards) the names of the composers, and sometimes the particulars of each musical work's circumstances, are known.
