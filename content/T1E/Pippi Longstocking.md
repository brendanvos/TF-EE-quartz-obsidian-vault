"With her suitcase of [[T1E/Gold Coins]], Pippi maintains an independent lifestyle without her parents: her mother died soon after her birth; her father, Captain Ephraim Longstocking, goes missing at sea, ultimately turning up as [[T1E/King]] of a South Sea island."

"Literary inspiration for the character can be found in [[T1E/Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]], E. T. A. Hoffmann's The Strange Child, Anne of Green Gables, and Daddy Long Legs in addition to myths, fairytales, and legends."

Pippi originates from bedside stories told for [[T1E/Astrid Lindgren]]'s daughter, [[T1E/Karin]].
