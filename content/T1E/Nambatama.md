# 1) Stalactites
Made of calcium carbonate
# 2) More Snowflakes
# 3) Rectangles
#Unsolved 
From left to right the rectangles are size 24x10px, 6x36px, and 107x2px
# 4) Number Spiral
#Unsolved
Attempts were made at undistorting the spiral, though no attempt clearly revealed all the numbers at once. It is suspected that a proper distortion to the image will reveal the numbers 1-18 monotonically increasing.

The top row of boxes is hidden beneath the stalactites. They can be found by looking at the bit planes for the 2nd bit of each color channel.
