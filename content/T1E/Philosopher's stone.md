 > The **philosopher's [[Stone]]**, or more properly **philosophers' stone** ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): حجر الفلاسفة, [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic "Romanization of Arabic") ([[Romance]]): _ḥajar al-falāsifa_; #Latin: _[[Stone|Lapis]] philosophorum_), is a mythic [alchemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy") substance capable of turning [base metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_metal "Base metal") such as [[Mercury (element)]] into [[Gold]] (_[chrysopoeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysopoeia "Chrysopoeia")_, from the Greek χρυσός _khrusos_, "gold", and ποιεῖν _poiēin_, "to make") or silver. It is also called the [elixir of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_of_life "Elixir of life"), useful for [rejuvenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejuvenation "Rejuvenation") and for achieving [immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality "Immortality"); for many centuries, it was the most sought-after goal in [[Alchemy]]. The philosopher's stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, [enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(spiritual) "Enlightenment (spiritual)"), and heavenly bliss. Efforts to discover the philosopher's stone were known as the [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|Magnum opus]] ("Great Work").
 
### Names 
>Numerous synonyms were used to make oblique reference to the stone, such as "white stone" [[Pearl]]? (_calculus albus_, identified with the _calculus candidus_ of Revelation 2:17 which was taken as a symbol of the glory of heaven), _[vitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitriol "Vitriol")_ (as expressed in the [backronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym "Backronym") _Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem_) #Occult, also _lapis noster_, _lapis occultus_, _in water at the box_, and numerous oblique, mystical or mythological references such as _[Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam "Adam"), Aer, Animal, Alkahest, Antidotus, [Antimonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony "Antimony"), Aqua benedicta, Aqua volans per aeram, [Arcanum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/arcanum "wikt:arcanum"), Atramentum, Autumnus, Basilicus, Brutorum cor, Bufo, Capillus, Capistrum auri, Carbones, [Cerberus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus "Cerberus"), [[Chaos (cosmogony)]], Cinis cineris, [Crocus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocus "Crocus"), Dominus philosophorum, Divine quintessence, Draco elixir, Filius ignis, Fimus, Folium, Frater, Granum, Granum frumenti, Haematites, Hepar, Herba, Herbalis, Lac, Melancholia, [[Egg cell|Ovum]] philosophorum, Panacea salutifera, [Pandora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora "Pandora"), [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], Philosophic [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]], Pyrites, Radices arboris [[The Sun|Sol]]ares, Regina, #Rex regum, Sal metallorum, Salvator terrenus, Talcum, Thesaurus, Ventus hermetis_. Many of the medieval allegories for a Christ were adopted for the _lapis_, and the Christ and the Stone were indeed taken as identical in a mystical sense. The name of "Stone" or _lapis_ itself is informed by early Christian allegory, such as [Priscillian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priscillian "Priscillian") (4th century), who stated,
>"_Unicornis est Deus, nobis petra Christus, nobis lapis angularis Jesus, nobis hominum homo Christus_ (One-horned is God, [[Christ]] the rock to us, Jesus the cornerstone to us, Christ the man of men to us.)"

## Creation
> The philosopher's stone is created by the alchemical method known as The Magnum Opus or The Great Work. Often expressed as a series of color changes or chemical processes, the instructions for creating the philosopher's stone are varied. When expressed in colors, the work may pass through phases of [nigredo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigredo "Nigredo"), [albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo_(alchemy) "Albedo (alchemy)"), [citrinitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrinitas "Citrinitas"), and [rubedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubedo "Rubedo"). When expressed as a series of chemical processes it often includes seven or twelve stages concluding in [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_(alchemy) "Multiplication (alchemy)"), and [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(alchemy) "Projection (alchemy)").

### Middle Ages
> In the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [Arab empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate "Caliphate"), early medieval alchemists built upon the work of Zosimos. Byzantine and [Muslim alchemists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy_and_chemistry_in_medieval_Islam "Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam") were fascinated by the concept of metal transmutation and attempted to carry out the process. The eighth-century [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim "Muslim") alchemist [Jabir ibn Hayyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabir_ibn_Hayyan "Jabir ibn Hayyan") ([Latinized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") as _Geber_) analyzed each classical element in terms of the four basic qualities. Fire was both hot and dry, earth cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air hot and moist. He theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them interior and two exterior. From this premise, it was reasoned that the transmutation of one metal into another could be effected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. This change would be mediated by a substance, which came to be called _xerion_ in Greek and _al-iksir_ in Arabic (from which the word _[elixir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir "Elixir")_ is derived). It was often considered to exist as a dry red powder (also known as _al-kibrit al-ahmar_, red sulfur) made from a legendary stone—the philosopher's stone. The elixir powder came to be regarded as a crucial component of transmutation by later Arab alchemists.
