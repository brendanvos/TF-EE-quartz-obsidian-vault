# 1) Hidden letters
The letters V,I,F,R,M are apparent in the confetti. This spells OVIFORM without the O's; directly pointing to the clue.

A suspected letter "A" was also found, possibly pointing to the feminine form "OVIFORMA".

I believe I also may have found a O or 0, which stands out less than the other letters.

# 2) Saturn

# 3) Three stars
Possibly referencing Galileo's description of Saturn.
